              <p>On the 2nd of October the Open Cities / Open Data workshop took place at the University of New South Wales. The day involved a mixture of keynote presentations and then two seperate discussion sessions running along side each other. I was invited by Scott Hawken of the Smart Cities research cluster to submit an abstract on my maker space research, and subsequently asked to present in the Collaborative Cities discussion stream.</p>

<p>The workshop aimed to explore the potential for digital technologies to make cities more accessible, democratic and inclusive.  The focus of the delegates was spread across three streams of data, crowd sourced data, data compiled by businesses into online databases, and data released in an open format by government agencies, considering how it could contribute to making cities more inclusive and open. Positive outlooks on the use of technology in cities were critiqued via issues of urban anonymity, sociability, privacy and transparency. Panel discussions covered the challenges, dangers and opportunities of achieving open cities through the use of open data.</p>

<p>My presentation was a overview of the Byera Hadley travel to the US under the guise of Maker Cities Open Data. In contrast to the “Bigness” of data gaining most of attention from participants (with the exception of Marcus Foth’s excellent Keynote), my talk identified more open channels for personal data sharing, around the “designing” of things.</p>

<h1 id="abstract">Abstract;</h1>

<p>This paper explores how shared data in the form of 3d digital models coupled with open source modelling software and access to desktop scaled digital fabrication has the potential to change the way citizens engage with the shaping of their cities. Rapid digital prototyping could provide the means to help understand, reinterpret and generate new types of urbanism through crowdsourced ideas, and open citizen design engagement.</p>

<p>“Maker Cities” hint at such an outcome where web technologies, spaces providing fabrication equipment and citizen collaboration are producing bottom up changes to the urban fabric or highlighting specific need for top down action [^1]. As the internet became a platform for democratisation and expression, so too can the city which has the potential to become a living laboratory of dynamic DIY urbanism.</p>

<p>Amateur making and its associated “maker movement”, has emerged globally as communities of people engage in making as a social activity, whilst addressing personal or collective problems. Activities in such community spaces range widely, they include technological empowerment, peer to peer collaboration, project-based technical training, local problem solving, high tech entrepreneurial activity and grassroots research. The movement has grown in relation to the increased availability of software and hardware for digital 3d design and fabrication through reduced cost. This is providing a shift in the means of production from large scale industry to small scale personal fabrication, reversing the mass production of early twentieth century capitalism. The proliferation of desktop personal fabricating machines into community spaces is analogous to the accessibility of personal computing in the 1980s[^2].</p>

<p>This research intends to explore the potential for a new digital urban vernacular where new urban forms emerge through empowered citizen makers and collective negotiation of a complex social, economic and political forces.</p>

<h1 id="presentation-sections">Presentation sections;</h1>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>In Michel Bauwens book “ Network Society and Future Scenarios for a Collaborative Economy.” he refers to peer to peer collaboration as a way to revolutionise production and society. Rather than reiterate his predictions I would like to consider design potential and think about what other open data sharing practices can enhance peer to peer influence.</p>

<p>In this presentation I would like to share some observations I had from the trip in relation to collaborative and open data, identify existing frameworks that foster collaboration, present some architectural / urban outcomes, speculate regarding new data opportunities and potential for increased design quality in maker collaboration.</p>

<p><strong>Making Culture - Spaces of personal fabrication</strong></p>

<p>My research trip focussed on two cities in the US, Boston and San Fransisco as they provided a broad selection of types of maker spaces. These ranged from anarchic hackerspaces, through to established and sophisticated tech incubators. All the spaces utilised increased affordability in digital desktop fabrication
each providing new accesses to means of production.</p>

<p><strong>Observations from travel</strong></p>

<p>Some key observations from the study were;
1. Virtual connectivity rather than destroying physical connection had facilitated more collective engagement / sharing
2. Evolution of digital use from pure 2 way communication to provide multiple connections and feedback loops.
3. Divisions of data openness and types of data - Types of data (digital files such as 3d models and photos, sensor information,
tutorials, geo-locations)</p>

<p><strong>Collaboration / Mobilisation</strong></p>

<p>My initial hypothesis about the maker movement was that the creation of maker spaces would have a transformative affect beyond its immediate space as makers turn their their attention to their local surroundings, but I did not detect this happening. Instead I experienced extremely efficient communication networks and forces of mobilisation that create temporary event spaces.</p>

<p>Maker Faire’s are the optimal embodiment, with one White House Faire, Two worlds fairs, Maker Faire’s in nearly every capital city, and Mini Maker Faire’s in satellite cities and towns. Each event brings maker communities with internal collaborative practices together to share information and create new networked connections.</p>

<p><strong>Open Source</strong></p>

<p>At the World Maker Faire I met Gael Langevin, the designer of the open source humanoid InMoov. His robot exists as a system of 3d components small enough to be printed on a desktop computer. To participate in the project by building a robot, or developing the system of the humanoid, new users simply download lists of commercial parts and sal files for 3d printing.</p>

<p><strong>Open Design Data</strong></p>

<p>This approach is being explored in other design fields who use open systems to reimagine channels of idea generation and production. Platforms such as Thingiverse, Open Desk, At Fab and Wiki House provide digital files with embedded fabrication data allowing experts and enthusiasts to freely fabricate 3d models, furniture or timber shelter.</p>

<p><strong>Citizen Prototypes</strong></p>

<p>In San Fransisco the Market Street Prototyping Festival challenged its residents to design urban interventions and help shape the future of their city. An initial showcase along the street publicised up to 50 possible ideas for improving market street and visitors were encouraged to document and share their opinion. The most popular ideas were later built in a three day main event where pedestrians had the chance to experience, explore, and interact with the prototypes.</p>

<p>The event took advantage of local communities of makers already active in sharing ideas and knowledge and combined it with social media provide an significant feedback loop between creation and populous critique. Digital platforms reinforce physical connectivity and widen the extent of participation.</p>

<p><strong>Crowd Sourcing</strong></p>

<p>While making conjures up the image of wood / metal work,  electronic prototyping is also associated with the maker movement due to its close
relationship with the field of engineering. Distributed sensors via open source electronic kits, born out of Fab Labs, start to shift the detection of environmental  quality away from government control providing increased transparency.</p>

<p><strong>Fab Labs - Fab Cities</strong></p>

<p>Fab Lab Barcelona is part of the fab lab foundation created by Neil Gershenfeld of MIT. Barcelona is using personal fabrication and open sharing as a way to become self sufficient in terms of resources and materials. For Gershenfeld if an urban area can become self sufficient in its production, it can also remain connected globally.</p>

<p>He also asks the question “why would a factory worker go somewhere remote from where you live, to do a job you don’t want to do, making something designed by someone you don’t know, for someone you’ll never see, to get money to get something you want”?</p>

<p>The alternative is a distribution of smaller scale fabrication spaces which allow local production, shifting away from international flows of consumption. The Fab Cities initiative in Barcelona is creating a network of neighbourhood Fablabs, under the guidance of Institute for Advanced Architecture ofCatalonia, IAAC, and Vincent Gallant, the former architect of the city.</p>

<p><strong>New urban vernacular?</strong></p>

<p>Expertise combined with collaboration, mobilisation and enthusiasm can lead to a shift in control in the built environment. Once example is of the Fab Lab condenser, also from Barcelona, devised by Margen Lab, but developed and constructed by the Fab Lab network. The design system allows customisation and production via fab lab scale fabrication tools.Fabrication Systems like this provide opportunities for design participation in the built environment.</p>

<p><strong>New Data Sets</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>New data sources and increased ownership in personal data and open data sets.</li>
  <li>Virtual / Physical boundary blurring between collaboration in the two environments.</li>
  <li>New Vernacular styles through Digital fabrication and shared data.</li>
  <li>Increased agency for citizens in the built environment through greater creative input and production participation.</li>
</ul>

  	<p>Making Culture is a collection of thoughts and reflections related to Chris Bamborough's PHD research into digital culture and infrastructures in Architecture.

The Making Culture project was inititated by a research travel scholarship awarded from the The Byera Hadley Travelling Fund in 2014. This enabled visits to spaces of community making in Australia and the US to study and understand the potential benefits of personal fabrication for architecture and vice versa. It was interested in how community making could potentially provide a vehicle for architects to better connect the esoteric nature of architectural design and increase public appreciation of architecture.

The project has evolved since to explore how architecture can adapt to remain relevant in todays digitally networked society, while helping to reconnect digital culture and design with the material and tectonic traditions of architecture.
