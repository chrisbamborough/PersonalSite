              <p>The role of the architect is a hot topic these days. The gradual demise of the architect’s influence and agency within the building industry even provides enough content for <a href="http://handbook.uts.edu.au/subjects/11503.html">university course electives</a>.</p>

<p>When I read <a href="http://www.fashionarchitecturetaste.com/people.html">Sam Jacob’s</a> <a href="http://www.dezeen.com/2014/01/16/opinion-sam-jacob-how-architecture-can-regain-social-significance/">opinion piece</a> in Dezeen recently he commented that “(Architecture) might have to (or better, want to) learn from communications agencies, from advertising, from digital and interaction design and from research and innovation experts”. This got me thinking, I currently work at <a href="http://www.supermanoeuvre.com"><em>supermanoeuvre</em></a> who straddle the worlds of architectural practice and academic research and innovation, what do we bring to the profession and does it reinforce Jacob’s view?</p>

<p>An added interest for me also stems from my previous life in digital communications working for the extremely talented <a href="http://www.profero.com">Profero</a>. So given my position it seems reasonable to analyse whether Sam Jacob is onto something?</p>

<p>Firstly digital communications is a very young industry but one that is not afraid to reinvent its boundaries in which to utilise its talents. Whilst I was at Profero it changed from a digital media company, to digital advertising, to digital marketing, to digital communications and it currently identifies itself as a “Digital Marketing agency and online advertising house”. I left in 2005 at a time when people were realising that traditional approaches to marketing and advertising simply forced onto the web was not going to work. From this point Profero moved towards it’s biggest successes and carved an identity as a creator of ideas and experiences. This is not isolated to just Profero, other web design creative houses such as <a href="http://www.pokelondon.com/">Poke</a> and <a href="http://clearleft.com/">Clear Left</a> view experience, research and communication as paramount to their success. This is where digital platform design output moved from a product i.e. websites, to a set of diffuse design activities as I feel Sam Jacob accurately identified. What those in successful creative agencies realised is that experience is not only as important for the end user and sale but also the client and even intermediary partners, for instance media owners.</p>

<p>So simple, Architecture just needs to concentrate more on the experiences they create in their designs and justify their significance through analysis of satisfaction and publicity right? Unfortunately I don’t think it is this simple as Architecture and Digital Design are far from comparable fields.</p>

<p>In the digital realm clients approach the creative services to craft ideas/ messages/experiences in which to influence customers, and in the end ultimately sell something to. Digital communications can one way or another achieve this over a range of timescales and quantify its influence in the process by extremely accurate cookie data tracking and embedded analytics. Design is seen as critical within this because they can easily prove with quantities that as the former improves so does the latter. There is no threat of a web developer simply taking on production without creative input to make it cheaper because it is recognised that the outcome will not be as successful and not as cost effective as involving the whole process.</p>

<p>With Architecture there is very rarely a final transaction that can be pinpointed (maybe with retail space design) in which to focus the success of design, it is far more open ended with the possibility of multiple scales, uses, cultures and stakeholders with individual aims in mind. Instead I think Architecture needs to get more architectural, but get smart with it. In order for Architecture to gain more significance in this neo liberal capital systems we are inadvertently part of it needs to prove that its design output be it ideas, experiences, buildings, systems, softwares, creates more return on investment (economic, social, cultural capital) than a standard solution.</p>

<p>We in the industry need to develop more contemporary tools for the measurement of architecture’s success, it is the wicked problem of quantifying aesthetics but I think rather than focussing on money and capital gain the focus is shifted onto cultural and social influence. The one thing that sets the digital communications work apart is their use of the web and networked technologies. What if architects were to build in a process of post project success analysis using exposure on social media and image aggregations to justify its effective impact. This wouldn’t see a dilution of the Architects already weakened position across diffused non spatial services, but rather develop a capitalist language about the benefits of quality designed space that potential commissioners of space value and understand.</p>
