              <p>The spaces included in this study are all bound by a common spatial situation, they are all adaptive reuse of architectural types. In this section I aim to highlight the typologies that have been adapted to suit the needs of maker communities and wether these original spatial intentions work for their new residents.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20394991/MakingCulture/03_Types/Adfablab-26.jpg" alt="Adelaide Fablab" width="846px" /></p>

<h1 id="classrooms">Classrooms</h1>

<p>Adelaide’s Fab Lab sits with the College of Arts (ACA) designed by Hassel Architects which is home to TAFE level creative arts training. The building itself consists of a wonderful multilevel atrium that feeds open plan classroom space along the perimeter of the building. The Fab Lab is on the fourth floor providing great access  for students but no visibility to Adelaide’s street life.</p>

<p>The classroom type actually serves the fabrication space well with an open plan rectangular layout, wall space, and large windows for natural light. High ceilings offer a feeling of space and the opportunity to feed power lines down to serve central working desks. The only difficultly the Fab Lab experiences is extraction for the laser cutter but a bit of HVAC hacking (with ACA’s support) had brought some relief to this problem.</p>

<h1 id="basements">Basements</h1>

<p>While classrooms bring the benefit of being located near to students and demand, it isn’t the only type of space educational institutions have available. MIT’s Hobby Shop inhabits a basement within building W31, a Gymnasium which was once a state armory designed by Hartwell Richardson &amp; Driver. The basement is  rectilinear with regular columns every three metres, solid brick construction and 3.2 metre high ceilings.</p>

<p>The basement could be seen as the perfect place for fabrication, isolated for noise, ceiling space for services and extraction, and pockets of space to locate and organise machinery. The basement type also suffers from a publicity problem. The Hobby Shop it is so hidden that it relies on street signage to catch attention and guide you through a maze of corridors. The subterranean space also creates issues for extraction with circulation having to be forced upwards, not to mention no available natural light.</p>

<h1 id="offices">Offices</h1>

<p>Offices provide an interesting type of spatial use due to their transient nature. An office is mainly used during the day, but unless someone is working late these spaces are left empty and unused at night. At Cambridge Hackspace this scenario is utilised. After working hours are over at the co-working space Industry Lab the group move in to use the communal meeting area and small workshop in which to explore personal projects.</p>

<p>Similar to a function room of a community centre this vacated meeting space provides the physical connection for the Hack Space’s members. A small raised platform offers a focus to the workspace for holding lectures, or hosting music performances.</p>

<p>By  far the most popular type of space experienced in this study are the pockets of building fabric left vacant through the redistribution of industrial activity. Within this typology I identified two subtypes, those that embraced the industrial and those that have refurbished to suit their needs. Of the former The Artisan Asylum (AA) is an example of making that aligns itself with the original paper factory aesthetic of the building. Although all types of making occurs at AA it is the large metal based mechanical projects that sit so naturally within the sparse fabric of the building.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20394991/MakingCulture/03_Types/Artisanasylum-03.jpg" alt="Artisan Asylum" width="846px" /></p>

<h1 id="post-industrial">Post Industrial</h1>

<p>The original factory needed to maximise floor space for production processes and the AA today benefits from this ambition. Interestingly, it is the secondary layer of studio cubicles which generates a variety and texture within the space not experienced anywhere else.The building of the AA provides a basic column framework from which secondary configuration and customisation of space is produced from 1200mm high stud walls.</p>

<p>The latter subtype is defined by Autodesk’s Pier 9 and Techshop who have both refurbished industrial buildings to create new hybrid spaces. In Autodesk’s case the pier’s long finger like form and cast iron sub structure provides a free plan, always close to the building perimeter, from which to construct necessary thresholds. Such an original spatial condition has allowed Autodesk to incorporate light industrial activities adjacent to offices catering to creative pursuits as well as social spaces.</p>

<p>Libraries as a spatial type are significant as these are the types that are currently the most engaged in making through digital fabrication. If considered through the traditional notion of a library, commonly quiet and compartmentalised spaces for individual knowledge consumption, the incorporation of making could not seem more out of place. It is the contemporary re-configuration of libraries as generators and  distributors of culture that has attracted new modes of cultural engagement and community involvement.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20394991/MakingCulture/03_Types/Bostonpubliclibrary-20.jpg" alt="Boston Library" width="846px" /></p>

<h1 id="libraries">Libraries</h1>

<p>Boston and Adelaide are both examples of where this shift has happened and although, at this stage, only 3d printing is provided it is the combination of the means to design (digital modelling software) and the means to produce that provide alternative avenues for learning and creation.</p>

<p>An example in Australia of a fully provisional fabrication space in a library exists in the Edge, a provision from the State Library of Queensland. It aims to encourage creative pursuits to generate experimentation and innovation. Its Fabrication Lab is set up in the basement of the 2007 building designed by Donovan Hill and Peddle Thorp. Here a full suite of sewing machines, Hand Tools, Soldering Irons, 3D Printers and CNC Machines offer opportunities for creative exploration on top of an organised design education platform called Auxiliary Design School.</p>

<p>In this study if a basement provided the least visible example of fabrication space, then retail offers the highest. Four very different making business models which inhabit different retail contexts gave insight into this typologies suitability.</p>

<h1 id="retail">Retail</h1>

<p>Danger Awesome squeezes into an high street shop, with a secondary basement space that connects to the streetwalk. The space is small and as a result 3d printers, laser cutters and fabricated goods dominate the floor are. Its cramped nature means that it is not very suitable for open access but it is extremely visible and was full of curious people viewing the fabricated goods, the machinery and asking questions.</p>

<p>If viewed as an attempt to publicise the uses of digital fabrication, Danger Awesome’s spatial set up is very successful. Large windows that once provided natural light serve as perfectly proportioned lenses into the world of 3d printing. The retail typology in this case is extremely beneficial with a capacity to connect to the street, advertise to street traffic and become an accepted addition to the commercial landscape.</p>

<p>Of course in America not all retail environments are open air streets, there are also malls, lots of malls. One in particular, Arsenal Mall in the Watertown area of greater Boston, was bought in 2013 and the Arsenal Project was devised to incrementally develop to adapt to the needs of the local residents and visitors. Through community input, support, and combined resources it aims to develop a more relevant base of services and redefine the potential of a modern mall.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20394991/MakingCulture/03_Types/Makersplace-08.jpg" alt="Boston Library" width="846px" /></p>

<p>Their first addition to the traditional retail base was the Hatch Makerspace. Its addition has been successful in tapping into the young population who pass time at the mall and attracting groups of people to participate in free workshops. Although the Arsenal Project had brought a maker space into its mall it hadn’t allowed Hatch to augment the interior mall’s space which I felt was a missed opportunity. The future of a maker space within a mall could be to use it as source of ideas and a test bed for new types of public / private space.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20394991/MakingCulture/03_Types/Makersplace-01.jpg" alt="Boston Library" width="846px" /></p>

<p>This was definitely the case with The Makers Place in Sydney. They inhabit a previous cafe / restaurant space and when the Makers Place is active they expand out into the Italian Forum via DIY furniture made from stacking pallets. These pieces of furniture are on wheels facilitating relocation anywhere in the public space and producing possible reconfigurations and informal meeting points.</p>

<h1 id="exhibition">Exhibition</h1>

<p>The Maker Media Lab is housed within the Palace of Fine Arts building in San Francisco. Exhibitions and conferences come and go but a corner of the great exhibition hall remains a laboratory for DIY making. The strange stage set like building, that mimics a ruined Roman palace, was once the home to the Exploratorium, a museum based around informal education for arts and science, that has since moved to one of the San Francisco’s piers. It left a legacy of discovery in arts and science and the Maker Media Lab uses this link to its advantage.  Its location within an environment that attracts such a variety of networked people visiting events means it acts as an important advertisement for maker culture and the media brand as a whole.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20394991/MakingCulture/03_Types/Makercon-06.jpg" alt="Make Media Lab" width="846px" /></p>

<p>If the exhibition typology offers the greatest provision of scale then the South End Technology Centre or Boston Fab Lab situated in a converted town house provides the least. The ex-residence sits within the larger complex called Tent City, named after the activist movement which saved the area of mixed income housing from being demolished during 1960s “urban renewal”. The Fab Lab’s location in the South End Technology Centre was an opportunistic move but I felt that the domestic scale of space was totally ill equipped to house fabrication machines and provide enough space for teaching. However, this does not mean that the Fab Lab is unsuccessful, far from it.</p>

<h1 id="residential">Residential</h1>

<p>The Fab Lab’s location is very important, it is right in the middle of an area which experiences high inequality and it provides an important resource to these residents. The area is residential therefore to stay within it, it must adapt, which it has tried to do but needs more space. The residential scale could also help to provide a familiar environment for the many young people it primarily serves. I doubt the Fab Lab would be as successful if located within a warehouse or office as perceptions around how to behave and act would be impacted by the space.</p>
