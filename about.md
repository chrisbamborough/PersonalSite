Maker Culture looks at the maker movement and its associated maker spaces from an architectural perspective.  

The Makerspace Playbook published in 2013 by Make magazine broadly defines maker spaces as “ gathering points where communities of new and experienced makers connect to work on real and personally meaningful projects, informed by helpful mentors and expertise, using new technologies and traditional tools.”

These spaces represent a new democratisation in the means of production provided through greater access to fabrication and communication technology. The cost of collaboration via the web has reduced and access to manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printers, Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) Routers and laser cutters, has increased, potentially enabling production to challenge consumption as the primary driver of contemporary culture.

The Making Culture project, initially enabled by a generous scholarship awarded from the The Byera Hadley Travelling Fund, is a quest to understand the potential benefits of personal fabrication for architecture and vice versa. It is interested in how Architecture can engage the public and increase the perceived value of design, and specifically how community making can provide a vehicle for architects to better connect the sometimes esoteric nature of architectural design and increase public appreciation of architecture.

Architects are well placed to become both the leaders and beneficiaries of this social and technological revolution. From model making and 1:1 prototypes to small design build projects, access to digital fabrication tools will increase the services architects could provide while additionally helping to reconnect digital design techniques with the material and tectonic traditions of architecture.

The original Making Culture research project visited community making spaces in North America and Australia from a range of social and economic contexts to record spatial data and identify architectural possibilities. The projects ambition is to cultivate this territory in Australia by providing open source information to enable Architects to explore speculative outcomes that could have enormous disruptive social, cultural and economic outcomes.
