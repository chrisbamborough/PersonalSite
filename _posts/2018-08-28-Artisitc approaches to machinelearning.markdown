The [last post][7277c25a] considered how state of the art practice in architecture uses Machine Learning (ML). The resulting argument was that ML offered benefits when designing material and structural systems where the complexity of material behaviour and structural forces could be better managed, but when applied to social relationships with architecture it presumed a level of spatial determinism and missed the correlational opportunity that ML provide through analysis of large and varied data sets. A common criticism in both material and socially aligned us of ML in design is that they presume objectivity in nascent data and conceptualise knowledge through a human understanding and applied to the computer, rather than explore how computers can develop their own knowledge. The projection of anthropocentric thinking onto the computer sets up a kind of master and slave relationship where data exists purely in the realm of the non-human.

There are art practices that explore this relationship and provide interesting alternatives. In such uses, ML takes into account the subjective designer as a data participant and radically rethinks the nature of data within a non-human learning system. An example of this is the use of ML in musical instrumentation and performance, in Rebecca Fiebrink'[s][9986110e] practice she instrumentalises human modalities into digital signals and treats data as a communication medium with a computer and interacts with resulting digital representation. Fiebrink's practice and research centres around technologies that enable meaningful human-computer interaction producing digital representations in music and art. Through ML she explores how the process of mapping required to teach the computer a relationship, can exist as a separate meta-relationship that allows a fluid remapping of human-directed input and computer detected pattern output. In this use of ML, mapping of data becomes a Paskian like conversation between human and digital[^ad8adea8].

Another alternative approach exists in the visual art, and "neural aesthetic" of Gene Kogan. In Kogan's practice, the computer becomes a site of self-organised-mapping that produce new outputs based on digitally detected relationships rather than being taught. Contrast here is the ability of a digital system to learn by itself (unsupervised) rather than having a set of human-defined relationships placed upon it (supervised). To paraphrase Kogan supervised ML maps structured data to structured data, and in the process forms a representation of the thing in itself [^f376af2d], using this reference to mapping and representation unsupervised learning is therefore mapping of unstructured data to structured data removing the human from the process of learning and representation. Instead, the human designer becomes a provider of data towards a goal; design thus becomes shifted to the curation of data through a considered system of collection and use. The [outcome][8263d021] of Kogan's work is a visual output of hallucinatory and sometimes unrecognisable imagery through a transposing of visual objects onto existing objects.

In considering two approaches to data in artistic practice, clear contrasts in the subjectivity of data use contrasts with architecture's assumption of data as an objective fact. In Fiebrink's musical practice data mapping remains consistent while data input varies via the musician's body, while in Kogan's work the data mapping exists as a fluid process and the input data becomes a creative consideration for the artist. While Fiebrink and Kogan differ in the degree of computational agency, Kogan focus is on the artistic use of computation while Fiebrink explores how humans can collaborate with the digital, both show how the design focus of data changes from knowing to a generative space of digital becoming through pattern recognition and fluid mappings.         

A future post will consider what the significance of these alternative artistic data uses is for architectural practice.
