<p>I recently went to an RAIA Tuesday Night Talk about the controversial project&nbsp; Barangaroo. Having only been in Australia for a year I wasn't totally aware of the history of the Barangaroo development proposal but did know that it was initially an international design competition set up by the Barangaroo Delivery Authority (BDA) to regenerate the old shipping container docks at North Darling Harbour.</p>
<p>The competition was won by Sydney based Architects Hill and Thalis, however controversially the southern end of the head land was then handed over to a single developer, Lend Lease, who won a tender with their Architect partners Rogers, Stirk &amp; Harbour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BDA state that the reason Hill and Thalis did not get to realise their design was because the competition was purely for ideas, however there has not been any explanation why such a massive plot of public land has been given over to one developer, it all seems a bit dodgy, especially given the lack of success seen at the Melbourne Docklands who were also developed by Lend Lease.</p>
<p>Rather than try and understand the decision making and then get worked up about the conflicts of interest that are apparent in the project, I thought I'd rather have a look at the style of images that have been used in the whole development process. In particular it has been the birds eye view that have been&nbsp;used most to argue for and against the development with some interesting outcomes.</p>

<p>Hill and Thalis produced an amazing model for their competition winning entry which set up this view of Barangaroo in relation to the density of the city business district.</p>

<p>The Barangaroo Development Agency took this type of view and started to adapt the designs showing how the proposed massing changed and the creation of two park lands. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Lend Lease (and Rogers Stirk + Harbour) announced their design for the southern part of Barangaroo and all the images concentrated on a straight on view that centered on the design but also showed the new towers as similar in nature to the CBD.</p>

<p><span>The most recent photos now available on the BDA website use this same view of the Lend Lease proposal but from a further distance from further away in order to show more of the city in panorama. This view appears to attempt to make the proposed towers disappear into the density of the city, justifying the increased tower heights.</span></p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7apgw5vPf1qb33g3.jpg" /></p>
<p>This justification continues with a view similar to the original BDA birds eye view, but also from a further distance, not allowing the eye to catch what is actually being built in the scheme, only how they sit within their cluster, thus extending the density of the city out to the foreshore.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;I think these new images try to justify the proposed density in relation to the original Hill + Tallis massing proposal, if compared though the towers in the image above appear to have grown to be much higher that previously intended.</span></p>

<p>Whereas the birds eye view has been used to promote the whole scheme in a positive light in a god like manner, those in opposition to the scheme have produced views based much more on the human scale. The image above was an produced for the Barangaroo Action Group (BAG) showing the scheme at an initial design stage from the Pyrmont Bridge with frightening results. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the Lend Lease proposal has altered, so has BAG's imagery, and this more recent ground level view shows the proposal's heights in relation to the city. This did not go down well in the AIA meeting with NSW President Brian Zulaika of Tonkin Zulaikha Greeg Architects furious by its crude and unprofessional nature, but you can't dissagree that it definately makes a point.&nbsp;The representation of height and massing relationships communicated above (I'm not totally sure they are accurate) are avoided in the birds eye representations used by those trying to get the project built.</p>
