As computers and robots become more capable in movement and artificial intelligence they will offer clients and developers a cheaper, more efficient and more manageable alternative to human labour. Research into the creative capacity of agents, or autonomous computation is already 15 years in the making (Saunders 2001) meaning that designers days seem numbered. Fear not fellow architects, this is an opportunity to become unshackled from AutoCAD and Revit, think of this as a chance to outsource the crap you hate, bathroom details...robot, door schedules...robot, environmental impact assessment reports...actually even the robot might find this too much. Rather than thinking of this as a them and us, it offers a new kind of approach to design and building, one where architects become robot owners, trainers, mentors. A two way relationship with a software or hardware robot provides a means of design, communication and production.

# Rob|Arch Sydney
I attended the Sydney Rob|Arch conference in March this year and this future was present, but through weak(ish) signals. I was the first time I had seen collaborative robots (HAL Robotics & Bond University), interactive 3d printing robots (Institute of Advanced Architecture Catalunya, Harvard GSD & University of Sydney and UNSW), and real-time vision sensing generative design robots (RMIT Architectural Robotics Lab and Southern California Institute of Architecture). The introduction of realtime communication between human, robot and material at this stage was clunky and not as "real time" as hoped, but it showed how the treatment of robots as subservient machinery through deterministic algorithms is no longer the accepted approach. While the outcomes shown at Rob|Arch were pretty wild and unpredictable, treating material behavior as an unknown in the design system, there is an opportunity for architects to understand the systems and create tunable outcomes, this is where training will come in. The progression of machine learning technology, and open source software tools mean architects with the right skills can take on the responsibility to continuously improve their own robots while engaging in the theory and practice they love.

# Personal Robots
As software bots and industrial robots become more accessible and more manoeuvrable via Moore's (Observation) Law, it becomes possible to imagine robot work cells maintained and constantly improved through interaction with architects, providing a liberation from the banal, and re-connecting with the built environment. It won't mean a loss of the spatial intelligence needed to be architect, it will mean design studios, construction electives and history and theory in architecture schools will utilise personal and collaborative robots as a means to understand the past and imagine the future.

In this scenario quality and ability will come to be measured through the architectural intelligence of robots which will reflect its human collaborators knowledge and capacity to teach. Beyond this, if the singularity is to be believed, the robot architect can take over the practice while the human architect goes and spends time with loved ones, or be killed, its hard to tell at this stage.
