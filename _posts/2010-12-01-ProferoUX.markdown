A few weeks back I was asked by a friend to come into his work and talk to his User Experience team about Architecture. His team are concerned with designing user experiences and understanding how potential customers use digital platforms. They were interested to talk to an architect to see if there were similarities in their approaches and possibly introduce themselves to new ideas.

Unfortunately due to my old powerbook being a bag of crap I wasn't able to show some images I had collected. So here they are in blog form, the images shown below were chosen in relation to how Architects are incorporating "digital" into contemporary practice.

Computer Programming and Algorithms - FORM

In his publication <a href="http://www.mh-portfolio.com/Algorithms_Architecture/contentsl.html" target="_blank">Algorithms in Architecture</a>, <a href="http://www.mh-portfolio.com" target="_blank">Micheal Hansmeyer</a> explains five approaches he has explored to create digital forms and spatial strategies. His work brilliantly communicated what can be achieved and the possibilities in Architecture for further exploration of parametric design, a great example of this is from <a href="http://www.supermanoeuvre.com/" target="_blank">Supermanoeuvre</a>.

The Descent of Man is a project created by <a href="http://archibureau.com/blog/" target="_blank">Archibureau</a> out of Manchester. It was a response to a competition held by Manchester Museum to design a pavillion for their forecourt. It uses object orientated programming in MAYA to analyse and manipulate data relating to Man's negative effect on the Earth. The resulting form is striking, both in its appearance and also by the experience it creates.

Visual Representation - EXPERIENCE - COMMUNICATION

As domestic computers get faster the rendering power of graphics cards means that digital images and models can be increasingly accurate. The above render is from <a title="BIG" href="http://www.big.dk/" target="_blank">Bjarke Ingels Group</a> from their Astana National Library. This accuracy is allowing virtual spaces to now appear so realistic that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality" target="_blank">augmented reality</a> is able to add to reality on the same level, rather than having the appearance of a bunch of pixels overlaid onto video.

Digital Facades - AESTHETIC

Art provides the testing grounds for architectural ideas and one such exploration looked to make walls display images. Crown Fountain was a digital facade created by <span><a title="Jaume Plensa" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaume_Plensa">Jaume Plensa</a>,</span> for the Loop community area in Chicago's Millennium Park. This art work used LEDs to display videos on the inward faces of glass bricks. This art realisation of an idea allows Architects to have a tangible object in which to work from and develope further ideas and uses from in the future. Maybe one such manifestation could be a digital front door that changes colour daily, constantly changing the look of the street.

<span>Robotic Printing </span>- AESTHETIC

The <a title="Facade Printer" href="http://www.facadeprinter.org/en/index.php" target="_blank">Facade printer</a> uses the accuracy of binary programming to control a robotic arm and paint ball gun, the results are pointillist images in <a href="http://www.facadeprinter.org/en/gallery.php" target="_blank">hard to reach places</a>.

This presentation was meant to show a few ways that "digital have been incorporated into Architecture and was not meant to be an exhaustive list, more of a conversation starter.

If you have any other examples please leave me a comment, or just a comment?
