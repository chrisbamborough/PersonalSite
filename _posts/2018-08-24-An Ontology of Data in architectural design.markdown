In the article "Machine Learning for architectural design: Practices and infrastructure" [^a3360382] Martin Tamke, Paul Nicholas and Mateusz Zwierzycki explore the use of machine learning through their own and others work. Towards a general understanding, they describe the method of machine learning in the process of design, and as an outcome of design when integrated into an architectural result. In both cases the training of algorithms through data can be used towards pattern and anomaly detection, prediction (as opposed to human intuition), understanding, searching and discovering different, complex design outputs, and a shift from precise replication in production to higher levels of flexibility, adaptability and integration.

The cultural awareness of Machine Learning is high due to its much-publicised use in consumer technology through software platforms, and via "big data" used in business domains such as retail and travel. The increasing design research on machine learning is interesting to my thesis, not as an innovative technique but as a shift in an attitude towards data's, in their own words "a radical shift of paradigm from architectural representations of unconnected data to practices with an overwhelming amount of information-rich data"[^e5da8867]. In machine learning data is treated as an introduced input into a computational analysis, an output towards prediction and decision making, and is produced through an iterative design process. To use Tamke, Nicholas and Zwierzycki's terms data exists as an externally resourced, internally generated or externally generated material for action in design decision making[^13bcf5ba].

The research completed on machine learning in architectural design, covered in the article, is directed towards physical structural systems, and design to production workflows. In both cases, material systems and aesthetics are favoured over architecture's social role indicating a lack of critical interrogation in the spatial conditions they produce, and the position of data in this process. To do this requires a framework for an ontology of data in architectural design that can consider data in spatial and material design practices. Other disciplines such as digital humanities [^bdef4c7d]  have developed ontologies for understanding data, but architectural design has as yet resisted this interrogation. Tamke, Nicholas and Zwierzycki claim this is not possible as the building professions require too heterogeneous data, but this requires more examination to see if it is true.

The thesis of my research is that an having an ontology of data in contemporary design provides architecture with a critical tool to consider its actions within an increasingly data-driven context, to understand this ontology in a historical progression, and to ultimately speculate on how architectural design may engage with data beyond the scope of material systems.
