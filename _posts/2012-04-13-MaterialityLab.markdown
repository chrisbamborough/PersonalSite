13th April was the interim crit for Materiality lab. The main outcome for the presentation was an assemblage using a combination of prototypes developed during the previous 6 weeks. I decided to go for a large assemblage that used my Eyelet prototype in a number of different ways to achieve a transition for lightweight tectonic, to solid streotomic expression.

This transition took Gotfried Semper's theory of Matabolism from the late 1800s as a point of research departure. Whilst the crit seemed to go well and I was happy with the verbal presentation, fitting all things I wanted to present in the allotted time, I realised that the expectation was to actually present all my prototypes rather than the development to my assemblage. The problem i found was that my prototypes had taken two research trajectories, one of bending (moment capacity), the other twisting (strip morphologies), as a result I hadn't combined the two directions into an interim assemblage. Although my process was documented within a book the presentation only touched on part of my work which I think was a missed opportunity. Saying that I thought there was enough exploration within Eyelet, and its parent exploration "Strip Morphologies" to make the presentation engaging and more content would have diluted the main message.

In terms of critique the main point of discussion was the joining of the EyeLet units which I agreed needs focus on. One opinion was that it ruined the beauty of the structure, whilst another liked its "grotesque" contrast with the weaving strips, like Cindy Crawford's mole. I had anticipated this point with a study of alternative connecting methods but I felt the prototype used allowed different configurations and varying positions of structural stasis. I think an important part was the visual treatment of the extra strip, in the assemblage they were simply smaller sections of the 30mm wide strips used, but they could have been expressed, or even carry out a second role. This could be to thicken the structure, to allow cross over of strips, allow a variance in strip width, these clues for design development will be explored during the next series of prototypes.

<strong>Material Computation</strong>

Another string of discussion from the crit covered the calculation of material behaviour and the potential for computational exploration. Prior to the interim I had explored scripting of strips in python, and using the grasshopper plugin kangaroo to predict strip morphologies. For development it seems important to explore computation to uncover opportunities that I would have not have otherwise struck upon. This potentially could be research into sin and cosine calculations to develop weaving patterns. The main issue for the project is that the system I wish to elaborate relies heavily of plywood's capacity to comply with, whilst resisting bending movement. It is one which allows developable surfaces to be extracted, digitally this can only be achieved through physics based modelling which gets complicated. The ambition is to programme strip behaviours, whilst providing them the ability to detect other forms of geometry, and act accordingly. An extra level of detail would be to then overlay a second exploration of connection within the digital space.

<strong>Transition</strong>

A critical part of the project, the transition from tectonic to stereotomy needs greater exploration and control. In the Eyelet assemblage the transition occurred through a separation, rotation and overlapping of units to allow stacking. In order to allow overlap the connections parametrically varied, but the rotation and separation occurred as a negotiation between the two end states. To move forward I need to focus on accurately predicting and controlling the transfer, whilst making sure there is a degree of freedom in movement so the material behaviour can be visually registered.
