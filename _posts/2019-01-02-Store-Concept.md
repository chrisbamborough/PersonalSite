The design concept for a retail store used the technique of robotically fabricated bent metal rods developed by [supermanoeuvre](http://supermanoeuvre.com/) and [matter design studio](http://www.matterdesignstudio.com/). The project aimed to explore the capacity of rod bending to achieve a functional and aesthetic threshold to an existing space as previously demonstrated in the 2012 installation [Clouds Of Venice](http://papers.cumincad.org/data/works/att/acadia13_311.content.pdf). An example of how robotic rod bending is achieved is available on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/49283982).
