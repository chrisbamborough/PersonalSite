The mission district of San Francisco is a predominantly middle class but ethnically diverse area of the city. It is under immense pressure from gentrification caused by the expanding tech industry, but a large artist population continues to thrive despite increased rental prices.

On Mission street above a Mexican produce shop sits the Noisebridge hackerspace. The predominantly open plan space is 483 square metres and provides room for computer software programming, making hardware, 3D Printing, woodworking, art, science, craft, robotics and sewing to name a few. Hackerspaces generally differ from maker spaces in terms of a bias towards software projects. However many maker spaces are simply hackerspaces that re-branded avoiding the sometimes negative connotations of the “hacker” and broadening their demographic appeal.

In the context of hackerspaces, “hacking” relates to a process of creative reuse, in contrast to the unlawful access to software systems with which the media and governments are obsessed.

Noisebridge functions as a “hackerspace” through the technical-creative projects it facilitates and also how its membership structure works. The organisational hierarchy is flat with responsibility for the space down to those using it at the time, and the social and behavioural code is based on one main rule, “be excellent to each other”. Generally all major decisions are made by consensus but if a member wants to do something they must base the decision on “do-ocracy”, i.e. make sure people are happy with you doing it. The outcome is a very open, self organising space where members are free to explore whatever they want in respect to their fellow hackers.

I arrived at Noisebridge on a sunday afternoon to find it packed full of people, music playing and the space full of conversation. Thin and long, the space connects two facades that allow lots of light into a collaborative area on the West and a teaching / eating area on the east. The west is functionally divided into zones of particular activity focus with a central space for collective activity. The provision of lighting on each table, plus multiple overhead bulbs, suggested many late night sessions of hacking, reliant though on holding a key to the space.

I found the do-ocratic rule out the hard way by taking photos without asking those in the space on the day. However while it was mentioned it was not a problem and I was welcome to stay. I was lucky to time my visit on the same day as a “hackerthon”, an intense period working on particular collaborative projects. This day the hackerthon was around making “stupid shit” which doesn’t need much explaining. There was an anarchic feel to the activities on the day with equipment, books, people spread everywhere and it was inspirational.

Whilst walking around the space my instinct was to seek out the “manager” of the space but soon realised that no one was in charge. The realisation was quite enlightening that this large collection of people acting as joint custodians for the space providing a public space to explore slightly subversive activities. This access however is dependent on an $80 a month membership status and, as I learnt, open to a lot of abuse.

I managed to get talking to one of the members who spent more time than most in the space and by virtue of this  he seemed to hold more social capital. Ruben explained to me that in the early days of Noisebridge the ethos of welcoming the street into a self organised space ended in some very tense moments as visitors attempted to exert dominance over the space and in one case used their floor as a toilet. This for Reuben was the critical thing about the hacker-space that was so appealing, that its anarchic nature bordered on the chaotic.

Ruben had travelled extensively visiting other hacker spaces, particularly those in Berlin, which Noisebridge was initially based upon. The idea of simply opening your doors to the street and allowing anyone in initially made me nervous but Ruben explained that this was what the hacker movement was about, inclusion without prejudice. If you enter into the space and engage with the code of conduct you are immediately part of the community, but if personal benefit outweighs input then you will be asked to leave.

On the day of the hackerspace, the space was filled with mainly white males in their 20s and 30s. The organiser of the hackerthon, Will, had promoted the event through his university social networks and website meetup.com so visitors were generally from within an associated demographic. When I asked Reuben about the cross section of members he agreed with the observation of a male bias but said that it really depended on the activity organised at any one time. Other sub cultures of hacking were actively encouraged but relied on the energy of someone to mobilise that particular niche community.

I really enjoyed my visit to Noisebridge and feel I would be drawn to it if living in San Francisco. What surprised me most was the level in freedom provided for making and the intensely open and collaborative culture that had developed around it. The subversive but highly social behaviour at Noisebridge was inspiring and intriguing to think about its possible effect on mainstream culture.
