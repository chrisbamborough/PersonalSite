All the maker spaces visited during my research trip were located within particular urban contexts. Each space had its own specific set of internal desires but were also part of larger set of virtual and physical networks. In this section I explore the case studies at an urban scale looking at their contexts and connectivity in relation to the benefit to maker culture and possible knock-on effects.

# Education

My visit to Boston couldn’t have avoided coming into contact with University education with MIT and Harvard playing such a significant role in the city. MIT’s Hobby Shop is embedded in the heart of the MIT campus and benefits from the large student population the institute attracts. The space is faculty non-specific and as such benefits from a mix of interests and approaches to creativity. Its place within the campus means it is specific to MIT students but they are also part of the larger community of Boston and bring with them particular views on society and culture.

As the Fab Lab movement came out of the MIT centre for Bits and Atoms, the SETC Fab Lab in South End has strong links with the academic institution. The context for the Fab Lab is primarily residential and its users are young people from this culturally mixed neighborhood. The aim of the centre is to provide opportunities for engagement and inclusion in an environment of growing inequality in living and education. Through this it is connected to marginal underprivileged ethnic groups and via its successful education programmes into making it links to other community spaces and public schools in the area.

# Business

In contrast, the context of the Central Business District offers opportunities for more privaledged members of society. The associated networks of the corporate worlds offer connectivity that benefit certain sub groups of makers. In Boston Bolt provided an example of CBD location and due to the high rent the making activities are focussed around producing profit. In this context connectivity is limited to exclusive networks of entrepreneurs and investors.

Social inclusion is at the back of the minds of venture capitalists and thus the activities of Bolt only benefit those fortunate to develop a successful product.

# Peripheries

In most urban contexts the CBD defines the centre of the city and acts as a magnet for economic activity. Industrial sites in contrast inhabit peripheral locations in the city, or close enough that transport infrastructure and real estate forces render them unsuitable for their original inhabitants. Subsequently these post industrial spaces offer the largest unimpeded space from which to operate and examples like The Artisan Asylum and Pier 9 showed this. In both these cases interesting symbiotic relationships seemed to exist with other creative industries located in proximity. In Pier 9’s case a central access road acted as a mini creative complex stretching out into the San Francisco bay,  and in the Artisan Asylums tech start ups had moved close to use their facilities.

# The High Street

The high street is synonymous with medium to small scale retail conditions and lower densities than a CBD environment. Shop units, generally attached to residential types have a direct connection to the street scape and are designed to achieve an optimum visibility to pedestrians. A retail customer base pre-exists and the example of Danger Awesome shows that it is a good model from which to launch. The problem lies in the economic forces that work to distribute retail tenancies based on supply, demand and business turn over.  A community focused organisation will struggle to meet rental pressures without incorporating an element of trade into its business model. If it can balance the pressures then a retail context offers symbiotic relationships with other retail ventures, such as arts and crafts materials, or co-working spaces that require production facilities.

# Public Space

These pressures are no more felt than in a mall and Hatch makerspace.  The Arsenal project use Hatch to attract new types of consumers / producers into the retail environment but if success results in larger visitor numbers the demand for retail space and real estate prices will shift. Left to a capitalist cost benefit analysis Hatch would have to make way for higher paying rent.
Community engagement and personal alignment with a space does not stem from purely economic attraction factors. It would be interesting to study the transformation Hatch has on the greater mall and on local communities during the project’s life, and whether it is given a role to play once the mall’s new identity has been formed.
