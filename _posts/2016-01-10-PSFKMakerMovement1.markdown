I stumbled on [PSFK](http://www.psfk.com/) when preparing my research proposal for Making Culture and have been a daily reader ever since. It is hard to pin down exactly what PSFK is but ultimately they produce extremely interesting articles that explore the future of technology hardware, a trend reporting site. Some of it should be taken with a grain of salt as some articles are funded by commercially motivated products but generally there is much to learn by reading it. Importantly they recently published the [PSFK Makers Manual](http://www.psfk.com/report/makers-manual) Last October in San Fransisco PSFK along with PCH held an event called "The Maker Movement" that sought to "explore key trends driving the ‘Maker Movement’, offering practicable insights into the impact of these findings and suggestions for translating these ideas into action" [Link Here](http://www.psfk.com/2015/01/psfk-pch-maker-movement.html)

The event had presentations and conversations with those involved with the maker movement in San Fransisco and San Jose and the results were recorded for [You Tube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6dD2pBAyHtaV_Tndn5Qb-g) After watching the videos I thought three in particular were significant for this study.

The first was Carrie Motamedi (above) who is the VP of marketing at [Tech Shop](http://www.techshop.ws/) a membership service for access to space and professional digital fabrication tools. For Tech Shop the maker movement is about learning by doing, the learning comes from access to learning resources, and the doing from simple access to space and tools. The outcome is a disruption of standard practice, creation of new ideas, and passing on of information with the making community. O

Liam Casey is founder of [PCH][1] (one of the organisers of the event) and their commercial service is to design custom manufacturing solutions for startups through to Fortune 500 companies. For him prototyping is the key to the maker movement and sees maker spaces, that provide access to previously inaccessible digital tools, critical to the creation of initial prototypes. PCH then provide assistance to move beyond this as a prototype is significant to warrant development, through to possible mass production. Hackathons, accelerators and "PCH access" then provide access to knowledge and equipment to facilitate this, all for s cut I presume. Interestingly beyond the hardware projects themselves it is the maker spaces and communities that are rethinking and disrupting traditional approaches to manufacturing. An example he uses os of redundant workers is Silicon Valley exploring ideas and creating prototypes, the outcomes disrupt and "short circuit" the traditional manufacturing roadmaps.

Lastly there is a panel discussion between Daniel Pizzata, co-founder of Modbot, Jesse Robbins, founder of OnBeep and Guillermo Melantoni, senior Product Manager of Autodesk. Significantly Daniel is Australian and one of two Aussies presenting at the event, the other being Billie Whitehouse of WE:EX. Having two out of six speakers at the event from Austrlia I think reflects the number of talented Australians who have been lost to the US through lack of intelligent government or venture capitalist finance. All three panelists picked up on the democratisation of production, and the similarities with the development of software development in the 90s, but it was the future of distributed and flexible manufacturing which seemed the most significant theme in the discussion. As wage levels equalise production can be local saving on freight and environmental costs, short runs of products can be made reducing wastage and high end manufacturing on demand will become a reality as software access and literacy improves and fabrication communication becomes more dynamic.
