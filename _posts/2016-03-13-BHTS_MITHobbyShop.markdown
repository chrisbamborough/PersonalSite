Buried in a basement of MIT University lies the Hobby Shop. The facility was set up in 1938 with the ideology that all students at the time (all male) should have a hobby outside of study. The fully equipped wood and metal shop is used to teach students the art of thoughtful design and learning by doing.

Although originally located in a room in the basement of MIT’s engineering building, today’s space is in the basement of 120 Massachusetts Avenue, building W31. It subsequently has no windows, low ceilings and cramped space for over head ventilation and services. It is a refurbished space with the Hobby Shop moving into its new home in 2013.

Brick columns divide the workshop and provide bays for equipment and wall space to surround workspaces and storage. The in-between space is used for circulation while the perimeter is utilised for workbenches and storage. It is safe to say that the space is not custom designed but things are arranged with a logic of material process with wood and metal working as separate sections.

The Hobby Shop operates as a traditional workshop with mainly manual fabrication processes. Ken Stone, a member of MIT alumni and the workshop manager since 1991 felt that this was an important distinction and had the opinion that digital machines removed the need to fully know how to make things. This doesn’t mean that the space was without digital machines though, it contains a Laser cutter, CNC router, water jet cutter, 3d printer and dedicated computer terminals. For Ken it meant that before using the digital, members must first learn the manual techniques.

Funding for the space is organised around crowdfunding within the university and a successful campaign had provided a new laser cutter. MIT has its own web platform for funding and the laser cutter campaign raised $10,000 from student and alumni contributions. Whilst promising that the campaign was successful and enough people were willing to support it did suggest that the small joining fee required to use the space is not quite enough to sustain a cutting edge workshop.

Although membership is open to all students of all levels of abilities the core of users were from science and engineering courses as these subjects do not typically provide making facilities. Ken described most projects as mixtures of small scale solutions to personal or course set problems. He said he detected common threads around the space with students working together on projects, such as helicopter drones, or furniture.

Proudly Ken described the largest project produced out of the Hobby Shop, an airplane. Built in 1994 by John Urbahn, a Nuclear Physicist PHD student, it was made from wood, metal and fabric and built in the workshop over three years.
