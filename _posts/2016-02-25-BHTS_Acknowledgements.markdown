I would like to express gratitude to the Byera Hadley Scholarship for their generosity, and  to the Architects Registration Board NSW  for their support in making this project possible.

I would like to thank Mal Booth, the UTS University Librarian, for being my mentor, sharing his wide ranging social network and extensive information sources about maker culture.

This study would not have been possible without the time and warm welcome of those involved in the spaces I visited.
