The Cambridge Hack space was one of two “Hacker Spaces” included in the travel study, the hackerspaces.org define them as “community-operated physical places, where people share their interest in tinkering with technology, meet and work on their projects, and learn from each other”. Cambridge Hack space was chosen because of it’s unique position within a co-working space called Industry Lab. Out of working hours a modest fabrication area holding 3d printers and a CNC machine, expands into a larger open plan space where members of their community can help each other with personal projects.

I was welcomed in by Anna and Richard, two of the organisers of the collective. Although the community space is only open once a week they are among a few core members who have 24/7 access to the space. The Hackspace events are then an opportunity to connect with others in the Cambridge or Boston region who wish to share projects they are working on with each other, with beer. Most meetings are chances to indulge in technology with other interested and enthusiastic people, however some weeks there are designated workshops and presentations when the open meeting room converts to become a stage or event space.

Generally the hacking was based on around electronics and software but whilst I was there one of the members was gluing up and clamping some furniture they had designed for a new apartment. Anna and Richard were very clear that community was their main motivations for organising the meet ups, they have their own interests.  Anna is a keen knitter and Richard was developing a home automation device, they would be exploring these anyway but their enjoyment was increased through sharing. The community provides a social connection over shared interests and a critical mass of people that generates opportunities for involvement in external events.

Whilst talking to the users and being shown around the space it was evident that web technology plays a significant role in its success. The website meetup.com provides a communication channel to new and current members, and is popular within the tech savvy Boston population. It also serves to connect to other events organised around other interests, for instance Richard was also a member of a hardware startup, PHP and Internet Of Things events which complemented his own making interests.

I was only able to experience one hackspace meet up and although the crowd was primarily male and around 30 years old their overall membership base contains a balance of genders and wide spread of ages.
