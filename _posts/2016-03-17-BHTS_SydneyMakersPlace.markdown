During the 2014 Sydney Maker Faire I got chatting to Mel Fuller who is part of  Three Farm a social design enterprise based in Sydney. The group specialise in education programs that explore Life Cycle Thinking, Computer Aided Manufacturing, Assembly Techniques and 3D Design. The company is focussed on the democratisation of manufacturing, specifically additive fabrication, as vehicles to explore the cultural benefits of teaching design thinking.

Recently Three Farm were offered space to open a maker space through Renew Leichhardt, a non profit focussed on regenerating the Italian Forum in the heart of the suburb. They started the impressive “Makers Place” a community facility providing public access to equipment, knowledge and space. Their aim is to provide the conditions to think, make, play, teach and learn, and allow members to prototype, fix, modify & hack, up-cycle, run workshops, host & attend events and collaborate on meaningful projects. Their design philosophy ties into the concept of the circular economy and the Makers Place is the spatial embodiment of this approach.

The suburb of Leichhardt has experienced a marked shift in demographic and is today made up of primarily young families of mixed cultural backgrounds. The spaces of Leichhardt, which were designed to cater for an older and Italian ethnicity, have subsequently suffered as dining out and large group socialising has declined.

Renew Leichhardt was set up to try and re-stimulate the public space of the suburb through possessing real estate from land lords who had been happy to leave spaces empty to achieve negatively geared tax concessions. Three Farm were offered an old dining space in the heart of the Italian Forum from which to set up. An extensive DIY renovation was carried out by the team and furniture was up-cycled from wooden stacking palettes into benches, desks and shelving. A number of milk crates were donated to the space and in combination with a stash of crates gained from a previous events the team painted them white and converted them into seats, tables and storage opportunities.

Within the Makers Place they have a dedicated digital fabrication area, that combines a number of donated and borrowed 3D printers with desktop PCs containing sponsored Autodesk software. An electronic vinyl cutter was one of their first pieces of equipment and provides an easy introduction into digitally making for all members of the space, not to mention the ability to create numerous decals for the walls.

In a separate back room is a more traditional workshop with sanders, saws and a potters wheel. Divided from the main space but viewable via a wall of milk crates it provides a slightly dirtier but controllable environment to the rest of the space. The white crate divider also provides storage space for the members of the Makers place but is at a premium with only a few days allowed per project.

The main space is open plan to allow rearrangement of tables for  project collaboration or teaching conditions. Along the wall a new library is organically growing to provide reference into all things maker, sustainable material and life-cyle information. At the opposite end of the space kitchen facilities and wall space are provided to showcase members projects and communicate with the community.

The $45 monthly fee helps to cover operation costs but as this relies on a built membership base the Makers Place sought sponsorship partnerships. These are invaluable to the success of the space as the pressures of economic forces in Sydney can be stifling for socially focussed entrepreneurial activity.

Mel kindly showed me around the space before it opened to the public at 2pm. As visitors arrived the bi-folding doors opened to enable Makers Place to expanded out into the public forum providing seating and much needed greenery into the sparse and empty space. The folding back revealed small cabinets of 3d printed and hand crafted curiosities available to buy with proceeds going direct to the members responsible. A cabinet further into the space held  a selection of DIY robot kits for sale, part of a robot making event that the Makers Place holds.

As Three Farm are so heavily involved in creating community events it is no surprise that Makers Place has such a rich selection of organised happenings around making. 3D printing, electronics workshops for girls, yarn bombing, technology workshops and balloon mapping are just a few of the events that the space were putting on at the time for the public. As a result Maker Place and Three Farm have an impressively large number of connections within Sydney’s making community.

This network is critical to Three Farm’s social ambitions as it enables open sharing of information and helps alleviate the pressures of running a non-profit organisation.
