From the eyelet prototype and their ability to be alter their shape I firstly explored how it can be used in its tectonic state. My ambition was to allow it to scissor across a surface each eyelet moving to a closed state.

In its stacked state I tested its ability to scissor and gradually close with the ambition that the two states come to meet. The resulting assemblage aims to create two conditions of light and heavy, the ambition will be to find angles and the right lighting conditions within rendering to convey this for the final presentation.
