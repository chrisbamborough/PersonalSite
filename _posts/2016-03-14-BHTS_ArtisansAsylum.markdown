In the north of Boston lies the city of Somerville. Once a thriving area of heavy industry involving meat packing, dairy processing, ice and food distribution, it is now a hot bed of creative pursuits. A period of rapid deindustrialisation with an associated decline meant that the city had abundant empty space.    The area is now home to many artists who have helped to economically and aesthetically regenerate the area.

The Artisan’s Asylum is a massive maker space that utilises a 40,000 square foot (3,716 sq m) old Ames Safety Envelope warehouse and provide space and equipment for all types of making, learning and working. It has around 250 monthly members and combines communal space for fabrication with private rental cubicle studios.

My access to the space was generously provided by Chris Sledziona, a member of the space who uses it to develop personal projects as an outlet for his creativity. The enormous maker space provides primarily three types of experience for users, with a related increase in access to the buildings space. For temporary users there are classes held by established makers covering skills and specific project outcomes such as welding or building bike frames. For regular makers there are work areas, dedicated training and access to production tools. “Shops” are organised into material or fabrication process and cover computer labs, rapid prototyping, welding shop, wood shop, machine shop (metal), screen printing, jewellery and lighting, and fabric. For the serious pro makers there are the private studios which add a city like dynamic to the facility.

The studios are offered on an availability basis but Chris pointed out that the proximity of designers and makers meant that common ground was found and through collaboration and inspiration areas of specific interests had emerged. The combination of all this activity created the appearance of a type of emergent flea market where content reflected the users interests and extroverted personalities. The effect is a space of multiple informal meeting spaces where a network of making activities unfold.

In experiencing the space I was surprised by the energy at 7pm on a Monday evening. Chris explained that for the regular users the community generation of ideas, projects and knowledge is the main reason people pay to use the space, more than the availability of tools. Access to keen like minded people with varying experience and interests in a controlled environment create unexpected opportunities and outcomes.

Sharing is encouraged and the provision of knowledge, ideas, time, energy and in particular tools is critical to the space’s success, so much so that offering up equipment for others to use receive savings on rental costs. Chris did explain that this could have a knock on effect as if anything was accidentally broken through general use, it was the owners responsibility and cost to fix it.

The private studios of the Artisan’s Asylum set this maker space  apart from the other case studies I visited. What could be seen as a peculiar monetising of space in an environment of open sharing and collaboration in fact creates the conditions for the space’s most enduring quality, personalisation. The ownership and responsibility of space, with the combination of access to the means of production produces a surprising array of making activities. During the time I was there I witnessed electronic prototyping, furniture and lighting, jewellery, a boat, a gallery space for punk art work and a gigantic pneumatic mechanical spider, each with their own spatial requirements and personal solutions.

The centre also offers its  workshop to surrounding businesses for its employees to participate in making.  The provision and access to small scale manufacturing equipment is so attractive that a entrepreneurial hardware technology incubator called Greentown Labs located itself directly across the road. Resident start ups use the facilities to develop prototypes that would have until recently been sent  away to be produced else where in America or even overseas.
