After my travel around Boston and San Francisco I spent a few days attending a conference exploring the business side of making, and visited the world’s largest Maker Faire (so far).

My research trip was organised around the timing of the 2 day MakerCon conference, held in San Francisco. The conference explored the business side of maker culture and the emergence of a Make Media coined term “Maker Pros”.

Day 1 started slowly with a business start-up competition and series of entrepreneur talks but the afternoon saw some very inspiring keynote presentations, in particular one by Bethany Koby of Technology Will Save Us.

I was drawn to Bethany’s talk not jut because she’s an American ex pat who has been working with the UK organisation NESTA, or that her company is an exciting design-led, technology start-up focused on learning, but that they have designed awesome and delightful kits that I would want my children to discover making and technology.

The afternoon provided conference goers with the chance to move into breakout sessions which concentrated on specific areas of Wearables and the Internet of things, Hardware Manufacturing and Product Design and development. I sat in on the Internet of Things panel discussion but unfortunately learned very little about how makers could engage in DIY wearables or the innovation of this technology because they all seem to be closed systems.

It seems so locked up in proprietary platforms that have their own data types and storage systems that exploring open source avenues within this space is limited. Luckily I bumped into Kate Hartman at the end of the day, one of the wearables panel members, who is the assistant professor of the digital futures programme at OCAD in Toronto. I was interested to talk to her about possible connections between data recorded by the body and the experience of architecture.

Ending the day I sat in on a discussion organised by Make San Francisco, about how makers and product designers can become domestic producers allowing micro manufacturing to inhabit the city. The discussion involved Patrick Buckley of DoDo Case (who I have bought an excellent DIY VR from), Steven Heintz from Quirky, Dorian Ferlauto of Britehub and Alexander Micheal Snyder. It was interesting to hear the benefits and drawbacks of using local manufacturing here in San Francisco and gave some hope that cities can start to attract small scale manufacturing and regenerate making and craft skills to increase their cultural and economic value.

Day 2 of MakerCon started with an interesting discussion about Maker cities which involved Dale Dougherty of Make Media and Peter Hirshberg of Re:imagine Group who unfortunately only had 20 minutes to talk about the impact of makers on the city. Peter showed a few images from the Urban Prototyping festivals that happened last month in San Francisco and used a series of events, workshops, exhibitions, and panels to generate civic engagement with the city. The Market Street prototype festival challenged residents to rapidly prototype and present solutions to the most pressing issues in the city.

This panel represented the first session that connected to architecture and introduced a new mode of using the skills and ingenuity of citizens, and the power of open data in spatial problems.

Straight after was a presentation by Ben Upton about the Rasberry Pi a small linux based computer that works via a computer monitor and keyboard / mouse. It was invented in Cambridge (UK) and continues to operate out of the successful tech industry the city has nurtured. It was interesting in terms of access to technology, which in turn influences the access to CAD software and ultimately the means of production.

The Rasberry Pi uses the open source Linux operating system which is developed by a massive collaborative community and powers 98% of the world’s super computers and most of the servers powering the Internet. With The Internet Of Things (IOT) being one of the hot topics at MakerCon it was interesting to see a low cost tool that could enable connectivity of physical objects with the networking power of the web.

On a normal day a talk by Massimo Banzi about the future and dramas at Arduino may have stolen the show but on day one that accolade was shared by Geal Langevin, and Dr Glenn Green. Geal is the French artists who created an open source robot InMoov. The Robot can be 3d printed on a 12x12x12cm area bed and when connected to a laptop and microphone can follow commands, speak back and move in an un-nervingly human way. Looking very similar to the robot from the Will Smith film iRobot the InMoov’s body is made from 3d printed parts that achieve a tectonic system of body parts.

If InMoov stole the show for scifi fantasy, Dr Glen Green of Michigan University did it for pragmatic life saving. Mr Green, a paediatric surgeon has explored 3d printing technology to create splints to hold open tracheas in children suffering from Tracheobronchomalacia. The 3d printing uses material which disintegrates after a few years allowing the throat to hold itself open after a period of time and not rely on the foreign structure. All that was just in the morning session!

In the afternoon there were breakout sessions and I was interested to hear about the Makerspaces stream and the impact of making which definitely had a more socially aware conversation than the rest of the conference. Gary Rohrbacher of  Filson Rohrbacher and AtFab, an open source furniture design company, announced the development of the Design / Fabrication Lab in Amsterdam, a makerspace in collaboration with the Waag Society and One Architecture (https://waag.org/en/project/designfabrication-lab) devoted to making architecture and the maker city.

Surprisingly he was in San Francisco for a three day symposium with other collaborators other participants such as Testa & Weiser Inc, Jelle Feringa and DUS Architects. They were based in the Maker Media Lab exploring advancements in robotics, additive and subtractive fabrication technology, the rise of Maker Culture, Open Design, Maker Spaces and new entrepreneurial infrastructures.

My travel in the US culminated in the 10th annual World Maker Faire held south of San Francisco in San Mateo. This year on top of the standard Saturday and Sunday opening days the Faire opened on Friday for a limited preview. This was my second Maker Faire, after Sydney, which was dwarfed in comparison by the scale of activity even on the preview day.

The concept of a Maker Faire is effectiviely a large scale show and tell show. What makes them remarkable is their pulling power for making communities of all shapes and sizes. As the name suggests this world faire brought communities involved in maker culture from all around the globe, but in the tradition of American “world” events, most of these were from the US. The event was split between ten zones covering grass roots involvement through to high tech start ups and maker products.

I was only able to make one quick circuit of the site in the four hours available so I was keen to see what architecturally related maker projects there were in amongst the standard fire breathing robots and 3d printers.

Everywhere I went on this trip I saw Strawbees, normally these little strips connect straws to create geometric forms, but at the Faire Strawbees Mega provided the means to build your own Buckyminster Fuller geodesic dome. Mega connectors are 3d printed components that link plastic plumbing tubes and create large geometry. While this was not groundbreaking it did indicate that maker demand lay in making larger scale projects.

Robots and micro computers were the big attractors at the event ranging from cardboard turtles and drawing bots to sophisticated 3d printed humanoids. Large brands such as Intel and Microsoft were noticeably present around the show suggesting that the maker movement was now worthy of big business investment.

In amongst the businesses and community groups sat a few architecture / design schools. Diablo college of architecture and engineering produced a CNC routed surface of an interference patterns which received a lot of attention. It demonstrated how small scale machinery could create larger scale assemblies. As expected there was an obvious difference between this work and the hacker / maker space output, but it was interesting to consider how these ideas might inform community projects away from the faire.

My main take away from the Maker Faire was how economically and commercially astute it seemed with many point of sale opportunities and products on sale. The vision of a future where maker culture could eradicate a dependancy on consumer products was not evident at Maker Faire, in fact the opposite. Companies jostled for attention to market and sell products to a keen maker consumer audience. These products offer a hybrid approach, consumer goods that allow customisation or invention through combinations of parts. Making in this sense still provides choice, just for those not ready to fully leave the capitalist paradigm.

This may have been a slightly cynical view after weeks of experiencing independent making but at the Maker Faire capitalism felt very alive and well rather than being “disrupted” by collaboration and sharing. This is understandable given Make Media’s role in the event. The event made me realise that the maker movement and “Make” brand should not be confused. While Make’s magazines and books undoubtedly provide important information and inspiration to the movement, it is ultimately commercially motivated. The maker movement needs to try and operate away from economic forces and continue its focus on social and cultural activities.
