If Bostonâ€™s Fab Lab provides an example of emphasis in social over technical, then Bolt offers the antithesis. Here product innovation is the critical aspect of their maker community.

Within the context of the United States Economy, tech start ups are big business. Maker spaces in general provide an entry point into realising entrepreneurial ideas, but they can only facilitate development of ideas to a certain point. Bolt in Boston and recently San Francisco is a working space and venture capital fund for start ups developing products that operate at the intersection of hardware and software. The reason I wanted to include such a space into the study was to see what transformative effects the integration of digital fabrication is having on business communities.

Located in China Town in Boston, and occupying a spacious building that once housed light industry. The area is experiencing gentrification as real estate prices drive out many Asian Americans. Tech start ups are part of this economic force, new companies cannot afford high rents of the city so inhabit the lower rental spaces in less central locations. Currently investment in digital hardware products is high so many companies are emerging.

Bolt provides an initial home for such start ups with the added element of high level digital fabrication machinery. The Bolt space itself is very considered and designed to offer everything needed to run a successful and networked business. The top level is a shared open plan office, where companies create their own clusters of desks and laptops, whilst downstairs is where all the small scale prototyping and manufacturing happens.

The space is laid out as a collection of very high end digital fabrication machines each with a particular function in the development of products. CNC milling and machining (subtractive forming), Rapid Prototyping (3d printing, laser cutting, Vacuum former, Urethane casting) and Electronics each have place and are arranged in the order of their place in the development chain.

Design in this space is centred around preparing for mass manufacturing and represents a hyper capitalist paradigm within this study. Access is restricted to employees of companies who make it through the stringent pitch process at Bolt, but those who use the space and equipment must become proficient, independent and responsible. These lucky few not only have access to the means of production but also gain the knowledge of how to scale up and distribute their output.

Those start ups who are successful and become established more often than not move into adjacent building space in order to stay connected to other hardware companies. Rental prices increase as these spaces become desirable and demand increases, thus the original population has been driven out. I witnessed the same in the South Of Market (SOMA) area in San Francisco where companies like Twitter and AirBNB have moved in and prices have consequently risen.

Bolt represents something a little foreign in this study, a community of profit driven makers utilising exclusive space and equipment, making mass market solutions. The visit highlighted the position such spaces hold in the wider ecosystem of making. If the knowledge and skills they generate could filter down into more amateur making practice through volunteering or worksops, the sophistication of personal design solutions would increase and perhaps an associated perceived value in design?
