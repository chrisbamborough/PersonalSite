While Boston, Cambridge and Somerville have multiple maker spaces within their boundaries there are a number of other locations within greater Massachusetts that have their own unique making stories. One such place is Lowell, a 70 minute train ride from Boston. Lowell has a very interesting history which connects with the ambitions and potential the maker movement is known for, a third industrial revolution. The city is known as the birth place of the original American Industrial Revolution. Francis Cabot Lowell, whom the city is names after, was part of the initiative that brought industrialised manufacturing to America in the form of textile machinery. He studied mechanised looms on visits to factories in Lancashire, UK, memorised the systems and subsequently reproduced them back in his native country.

By the 1900s Lowell was the largest industrial complex in the US but soon after started to decline and suffered particularly badly during the great depression. Migration has always been part of the citiyâ€™s past and it has a rich racial and cultural mix. Today the city is a thriving university town and has a proud arts and crafts community evident in the numerous independent shops in the city centre.

Lowell Makes resides in the storage facility of a retail building connecting the main Merrimak Street with Lee Street, where Lowell Makes have their entrance. I visited on a Wednesday evening for their open house session, but the space is accessible for members throughout the week. After walking down into the basement it was clear to see that Lowell Makes loves making and engaging with the community. A notice board summed up their agenda: what would visitors like to invent, make, do, design, learn, create, build, teach? The space is packed to the brim with projects such as DIY bikes, DIY 3d printers, computers, electronics, wood work. As a non-profit, shared community workshop they receive lots of donations in discarded tech, and as a result have to find homes for all the pieces of equipment; storage is definitely a premium.

The space was set up by Eric, John and Kamal, who are scientists and engineers by trade and met at a class in the Mill Cities Leadership Institute (formerly the Sandbox Leadership Institute). Sadly Kamal, who I had been in contact with, had passed away a few days earlier from a farming accident which was a shock. I was shown around by the very friendly John Noto who gave me an overview of the operation.

Initially conceived as a Hacker space, Lowell Makes decided to brand themselves as a maker space as they were worries that the negative perception in the media might reduce their ability to attract a broad cross section of the population. While it was obvious that the regular members present on the night could quite easily fit into the Hacker stereotype, I arrived at the space at the same time as a lady in her 60s who wanted to learn about the 3d printers for her grand children.

Every inch of the space is utilised but perhaps not in the most efficient manner. The effect is a cluttered but visually rich environment of objects and tools, each seemingly in the middle of making action. There are distinct clusters in the maker space  that compartmentalise 3d printing, metalshop, woodshop, electronic prototyping, leather working, stage design and pottery. The main space is saved for communal seating where the open night was focussed around personal projects, and a bottle of bourbon. Tables provide space to temporarily spread projects out for discussion, and lounge seats offer an alternative environment to engage in relaxed conversation, referencing a  book, or immerse in a computer game.

The building they inhabit has other floors free and they next plan to expand to offer more classes for the residents of Lowell. The maker space is completely underground and as such has no natural light into the space. The community workshop rents the space but it is not hard to see that they must get a good deal.

This is the notable aspect of maker spaces: organisations that survive on very little funding, driven by enthusiasm and social contact, opportunistically inhabit the spaces that no one wants. Surely if Lowell Makes was visible the engagement with the street would be greater and visitors increase, but this is perhaps not what this maker community wants. It is a kept secret, a space to hide away and indulge in making for personal gratification and safely store away the collected and constructed treasures.

For a city with such a rich history of manufacturing and craft Lowell Makes seems the perfect vehicle to encourage participation and engagement with personal fabrication to stimulate economic regeneration. Its success depends on backing by the city to provide opportunities for funding and space. My visit suggested a latent creative economy which could blossom given the right economic, cultural and social policies.
