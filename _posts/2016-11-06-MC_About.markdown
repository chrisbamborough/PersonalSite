Making Culture is a collection of thoughts and reflections related to Chris Bamborough's PHD research into digital culture and infrastructures in Architecture.

The Making Culture project was inititated by a research travel scholarship awarded from the The Byera Hadley Travelling Fund in 2014. This enabled visits to spaces of community making in Australia and the US to study and understand the potential benefits of personal fabrication for architecture and vice versa. It was interested in how community making could potentially provide a vehicle for architects to better connect the esoteric nature of architectural design and increase public appreciation of architecture.

The project has evolved since to explore how architecture can adapt to remain relevant in todays digitally networked society, while helping to reconnect digital culture and design with the material and tectonic traditions of architecture.
