The case studies visited in this study were identified to provide different community motivations each providing catalysts for personal fabrication spaces to form. This chapter interrogates these motivations, the resulting communities and explores the spatial implications.

In Neil Gershenfeld’s article “How to Make Almost Anything” he identifies that the real strength of Fab Labs are not technical; it is social.In this study I visited two Fab Labs, one in Australia and one in the US. The SETC Fab Lab in Boston was the first and illustrated just how much can be achieved from limited but efficiently utilised space for digital fabrication equipment and space to collaborate.

The two Fab Labs in this study cannot be compared in terms of their social or economic contexts, but they both share an ambition to provide a space to explore and share personal making projects to citizens of all ages. Where as the SETC Fab Lab holds a corner of a basement of an old town house in Boston, the Adelaide Fab Lab utilises teaching space donated to them by the Adelaide Collage of Arts. Both make desk space to sit and talk a priority and use clusters of desks to make sure users can sit and face one another.

# Social Education

It is stated in the Fab Foundations guide to setting up a Fab Lab that “90% of a student or user’s time is spent designing on the computer” so it is not surprising that this has such a significant spatial impact.

In order to be part of the Fab Foundation a Fab Lab must be free and inclusive to all members of society. Funds can be generated by a variety of methods but a percentage of time must be devoted for free access and drop in sessions.

Initially Fab Labs were conceived as a way to extend the educational outreach of Gershenfeld’s MIT class and have consequently spread across the world. The Fab Academy now provide remote teaching via video link to all these affiliated spaces. The class seeks to educate how to use the digital fabrication tools at hand, but on personal and meaningful projects.

At the Boston Fab Lab the teaching of the Fab Academy is taken a stage further where young students of the programme are employed to go into schools and teach younger children and generate a sustainable cycle of learning and teaching. The programme has proved so successful that Fab Labs have been set up in the  schools involved meaning legacy of influence can hopefully be established.

Here in Australia the Makers Place take as much of a social focus as the Fab Labs, but are not part of the foundation. Makers Place and its parent company Three Farm use design and making across multiple communities to help gain autonomy and strength through self-identity.

If Fab Lab represents a laboratory of digital fabrication, then maker spaces are the factories. Artisan Asylum and Lowell Makes both emerged out of the Hackerspace movement, but have gravitated towards a focus on creativity and entrepreneurism, rather than activism.

# Creative

As such the maker spaces visited had generally longer standing projects and highly personalised additions to the interior of their space. Users of these facilities were typically more inwardly focussed, concentrating on individual pursuits and creative endeavours. In these two cases it resulted in a compartmentalisation of space allowing personal storage and ownership over a particular space.

Hackerspaces, despite the negative image produced by the media relating to cyber crime, provided the most enthralling of spaces  I visited due to their open and subversive atmospheres.

# Subversive

Although neither of the two hackerspaces I visited knowingly promoted criminal activities, they had a freedom and a shared connection in making (or breaking) that stood out. Although Noisebridge provided the more extreme example, both had few rules and instead relied on self regulation and honesty to maximise freedom in movement, interaction and open sharing.

# Entrepreneur

Techshop, the surprisingly unfordable “democratiser” of fabrication, sits rigidly within the entrepreneurial camp. However where it gains in making technology it lacks in the spatial identity seen in maker spaces. Users in these spaces were serious, generally working on projects for capital gain, and reflecting the motivations of the service they were using.

In contrast to Noisebridge, it is clear at Tech Shop who owns and manages the space. Limited time on machinery and a highly regulated environment remind the users who the space belongs to and who you are paying for access to technology.
The two libraries I visited, Boston and Adelaide, introduced digital fabrication facilities due to a conscious engagement with production as a cultural generator, and recent capital investments through refurbishment. Boston library, the larger and more established of the two, combined rapid prototyping within a larger computer lab. This space contained CAD software providing young people a complete design to production fabrication workflow to learn from and experiment.

# Adelaide

Adelaide Library’s community base means it is not able to provide equivalent facilities or space, but it is still able to engage users in designing and prototyping their own artefacts. Through the design and making of 3d models users are given the free knowledge to progress and are introduced to an alternative to consumerism.

In both cases knowledge is facilitated through computers, enabling those who engage and learn the opportunity to generate personally and potentially culturally significant artefacts.

# Fabrication Services

Danger Awesome proved to be the most surprising case study , and perhaps for the wrong reasons. What I expected to be a community led digital making space turned out to be a more retail focussed fabrication shop comparable to a print or copy shop. While I was a little disappointed that making skills and community was not as prioritiesed I appreciated the type of fabrication it provided, and the economic context it operated. In the future not all spaces with digital fabrication machines will be open to feely use, someone who has a digital file will in many cases just want to go and get it produced rather than hanging around waiting for it to be created.

The aspect I found disappointing was that through making for others it disengages with the overall ambition of personal fabrication where users can gain autonomy through their making activity. Nadeem, one of the directors at Danger Awesome is critical of the Fab Lab concept explaining that it was completely unsustainable as a business. While this is most likely true as Fab Labs need funding to survive, he misses that Danger Awesome operate as custodians for a culture rather than purely a business model. If free or low cost access to digital fabrication is not provided then the “democratisation” of making that Danger Awesome promote is just marketing speak.

# Corporate

During my study I spoke to many people who felt that maker spaces within corporate companies will become a more common occurrence in the next few years as business leaders seek to provide creative outlets for their employees. The two examples I visited are slightly different in that the companies, Bolt and Autodesk, are directly involved with the maker movement. They are both examples however, where corporate money provides the highest level funding and produce the greatest innovation.

The interesting aspect for maker spaces within companies is the possibility for employers to engage with disruptive consumption patterns. Potentially, if employees can make their own things and not have to rely on consumption of mass produced goods, then why will they work to pay for them?

A more likely outcome, however, is that a maker space, and allocated usage times, will provide incentives to work. If companies allow time and space for making they could find themselves the beneficiary of new and unexpected ideas that could feed into the economic success of the business.
