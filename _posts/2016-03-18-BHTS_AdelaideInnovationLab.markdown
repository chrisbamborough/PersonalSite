A Located in the heart of Adelaide, the new City Library is anything but conventional. In contrast to the usually visible presence of traditional libraries, this library is hidden away down a side street and nestled on the 6th floor of Rundle shopping mall. It is a space that consolidates a number of previously distributed libraries and has called the mall home since 2014. As the library refurbishment is so recent a new approach was been taken and aside the standard physical space for books and reading are hubs that facilitate creativity, reflection, discovery, collaboration and production.

One of these hubs is the Innovation Lab and provides a very modest maker space providing three 3D printers, five 3Doodler pens, one laser scanner, two PCs and one laptop. The lab is only 20 metres squared and can hold around eight people sitting at tables but it is a focal point of the building. The day I visited I was able to speak with Mathew Croucher who volunteers to supervise the fabrication equipment, teach others how to use them, and answer any questions they have about the technology.

Mathew, a Mechanical Engineer by trade, was volunteering at the lab as he had found himself at the forefront of 3d printing through his own personal explorations in the technology. As an unpaid participant he was keenly aware of the difficulty in attracting people to give up their spare time. In his case, although he was apprehensive to admit, his motivation to help lay along side an entrepreneurial project he is running called Innovation Systems. This business provides corporate training and advice around 3d printing and fabrication, so it was a logical fit for Mathew to be able to give up his time.

Our conversation was enlightening and made me appreciate the realities of providing free information and services to communities. Ultimately those with the greatest knowledge, who have invested time into understanding the field, cannot be expected to provide charitable services. Libraries should explore public / private partnerships (in a capitalist economy context) in order to balance economic needs of their volunteers, provide free services to the community whilst generating innovation within the technological field.

I visited the lab during a drop in session where computers and printers operate on a first come first serve basis. On other days the lab operates as a sessional maker space where a booking can be made for up to five people to generate and produce 3d designs. These private sessions with a dedicated facilitator provide an introduction to 3D printing, modelling, scanning, 3Doodler pens, or for those already familiar, an opportunity to learn more through a personal project.

In observing the users in the innovation lab it was obvious that personal projects were the key to engagement. While freely available 3d forms are available through websites like Thingeverse and provide a gateway to using the 3d printers, it was the personalising of designs through 3d modelling software and immediate physical production that were most popular.

Although small at the moment it seemed there was potential for new ideas and solutions to be developed by users once the tools are learnt, and for them to be instinctively shared which made this space significant within the library.

Through the Innovation Lab the library is no longer purely the holder or curator of data archives, it now provides connectivity to a network of information and a means of production for creativity.
