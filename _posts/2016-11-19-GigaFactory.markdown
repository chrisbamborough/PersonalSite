Recently I stumbled across a YouTube video of [Elon Musk][d52b42f0] opening Tesla’s new Gigafactory. Apart from the astonishing fanboy following Tesla seems to have acquired I was taken aback by the [visualisation][8a1e38e7] of the future factory showing an enormous box in a desert with solar panels on top. Initially, I thought that Tesla had turned their attention towards production on Mars (that's still reserved for SpaceX) but the barren desolate landscape, turned out to be Nevada. In Musk’s presentation, he describes the new factory as one designed to be a machine, the new facility treated as a Tesla product needing "more innovation and engineering skill than the (car) product itself”.

Le Corbusier was known for the statement that houses were “machines for living”, for him that meant space could imitate the efficiency of a machine towards the provision of a particular style of life. What struck me about the Giga factory was that efficiency had become the prime ambition through space, but rather than humans, it is focused towards production process and equipment. Tesla’s strategy is clever but obvious, increase density and efficiency of equipment will reduce the marginal costs of production and in turn converge towards more affordable products. Musk compares the factory to a piece of industrial design, completely bespoke and customised to the process at hand, designed as an integrated product, more specifically a "very high density, multilayer integrated circuit, an advanced CPU...super optimised for speed and density”.

From his presentation, it seems that the new Giga factory, with its super dense collection of robotic production machinery and context of nothingness, is a fully autonomous facility where humans need not apply. Through a little extra background reading though it turns out there will be approximately 6,000 people working at the plant. Two interesting things for me arose from this deceleration, firstly is the consideration of what architecture for non-humans could look like, and the other is what happens to buildings when they are excessively over engineered.

America’s largest tech companies have all recently buddied up with starchitects such as [BIG][cd707fb0],[ Fosters and Partners][104524fa] and [Frank Gehry][63406d20], to create “campuses” or “headquarters” or “imagineer worlds” (I made the last one up). In all cases, the human (the commodifiable input into these corporate machines) provides the focus and results in spaces of work / life hybrids that bring light and nature into the office environment. What happened to factories? People still work in these environments, but it seems these can be treated merely as an extension of the manufacturing machinery it houses, and therefore becomes the presumed remit of the engineer. It seems Tesla needs to consult an architect.

In considering the factory and architecture and interesting history emerges. [Peter Behrens AEG turbine factory][2b5acb96] is known as being one of the first buildings that sought to reflect a particular company's product base and brand. In AEG's case, the factory was designed to communicate the domestic technology produced within, such as lamps, kettles and clocks. In 1909 production involved the combination of human skill and mechanical automation, Behren's design took care to provide favourable working conditions for AEG’s workers with considerate light providing fenestration.

Throughout the early 1900s, the factory remained the domain of architects, one of the most famous examples (due to the Italian Job) was the [Lingotto Fiat Factory][861e30df] by Matté Trucco which was designed around the assembly line of a fiat car including test track on the roof. Its architecture was formed around the production process, but still provided human-centric working conditions through air and light. Increased mechanisation and automation reduced the need for humans in the production process, for a potential factory worker this was financially disastrous, but for humanity, this could only be a good thing. Traditional factories are not healthy environments to be working, they can be noisy, dirty and potentially life-threatening, but it is ironic that conversions of modernist factories provide the most interesting domestic spaces due to their extraordinary scale and glass provision. At some point, the factory shifted from window adorned urban fabric to blank suburban estate boxes (or cylinder if you are [SANAA][b21585db]) fully internalising its environment through air conditioning and artificial light. Was this shift the point where the factory passed on from the responsibility of architects to that of engineers?

Something at the Giga factory seems to be amiss, with its 6,000 human workers there is no trace of human in its design. In theory, it can fully internalise its environment without ruining the biosphere because the sun and wind powers it, but shouldn’t humans be able to see some daylight? The Giga factory could be emblematic of a new turn towards Object Oriented Philosophy in Architecture; it has started to provide architectural justification for rejecting context and purely anthropocentric design decisions. Such a position could liberate architecture to explore new and unusual spatial types that consider human and non-human inhabitants, but the [Giga factory](https://www.tesla.com/en_AU/gigafactory?redirect=no) should provide a warning that if the human is removed from the equation completely, it appears architects need not apply.
