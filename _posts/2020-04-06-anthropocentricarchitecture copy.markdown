Architects love the virtual, why wouldn't they, no clients to worry about, no physical laws to obey, just a pair of eyes and an almost hyper real version of a non-existent worlds. The era of greatest virtual fervour occurred in the Nineteen Nineties, a time when architectural imagation collided with the digital representation of geometry and texture in 3d modelling software. The well known work that emerged came from Peter Zellner, XX, XX, imagined fantastical worlds experienced through the burgeoning virtual reality technology, that could detach the human brain away from the body. The brain emancipated from the material confines of the body.

From the perspective of mkaing material objects, Picon realised in 2004 that the virtual's main public image problem, was a lack of connection to material. As a response architecture brought the virtual and scientiic simulation together to visualise and predict physical outcomes within the virtual. This connection to the material meant architects became distracted from the advancement of VR technology and its ability to present a convincing visual reality. 

Today the technology has caught up with the promise of VR, the possibility of escaping physical reality and extending visual, or even tactile experience, beyond the immediate space of the body. There is still a neccessary interest in architecture about the material, the discipline cannot escape it, much of its creative focus is on organisations of material, but there are some -- including me -- always with an eye on how the virutal influences the material. This question also occupies the multidisciplinary design practice Space Popular.

Space Popular's project, the "Venn Room" is particualry interesting as it boldly makes a series of claims about virtual technologies and its potential influence on architecture as we experience it physically. Their prediction is that as more home bound people interect through Virtual Reality headsets the screen based surface of interaction transfers into a shared understanding of each others space and an eventual integration of both real world spaces represented in the virtual.

While this is interesting Space Popular stumble through a number of tropes regarding Virtual Reality which don't hold up their argument. The first is that it compares VR to other "virtual portals" such as telephone, television and the internet. It is not clear if "virtual portal" means the end of the portal is virtual, or if the portal itself is virtual, both which do not apply to these technologies. Space Popular claim that these technologies did not influence the form of architecture, but this is not the case. American suburban houses became shaped around communication technology, and David Rose assigns the loss of the front porch as result of the television, bringing attention inward rather than onto the street. The distinction between these early media technolgies and VR is that the end of these portals were mainly physical and analogue occurances, voices, people, scenes, to compare these to VR is misleading as the condition of VR is non-material and relies on the digital. Therefore, VR is different, it has no connection to the existing physical condition of the home, apart from sensors that demarcate the zone of headset movement.

While the horizon of technology does predict the ability of mixing reality in VR through mapping existing space and generating it in the virtual, it is not a current option. Therefore, a second assumption plays out that doesn;t quite hit the mark, the idea that we will recreate out home in the virtual space. An alternative reading of VR use is that the only relationship it has to the home, is the extend to which the home allows a zone of VR sensing, which requires no relation to a room if the room is big enough. 

My last problem with their understanding of the virtual relates to the scale of space, but through their assumptions of ownership. Here they once again conflate the material and virtual, which we know are for the moment seperate, that somehow in the virtual there will exist the capitalist notion of private ownership? There is no scarcity, things are immediately editable, therefore why would you need to transfer the hangups of political economy concerning the material world onto the virtual?

Space Popular are not the only to struggle to escape the unconcious structures placed on us my the way we govern and organise the material, when we truly enter the virtual it requires a whole new way of thinking of how the material and virtual interact.
