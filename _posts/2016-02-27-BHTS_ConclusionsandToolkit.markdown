In the last year the Byera Hadley travel scholarship has enabled me to gain a invaluable insight into the growing culture of DIY making and has already provided a catalyst for future focus. I am extremely grateful to the award and hope my experiences will provide inspiration for Australian based making communities.

# Movement

To conclude the project I want to highlight the major findings from my study through a starting tool kit of things to consider if you wish to start your own.
This is the first big decision to make, what will your making community be focused on, will it be social education, creativity, hacking, entrepreneurial, knowledge, fabrication service or even corporate motivations?

Of course there are other reasons for forming a community around making but the reasons and outcomes need to be clearly defined. A network is critical to the success of a maker space so look to start to connect with other people around shared interests, or tap into existing groups using online groups, forums or wikis.

At first volunteers will be critical to the initial success of the space so look to form a group of people all committed to creating a maker space so you can share the responsibility.

# Type

A maker community can initially emerge through digital connections, but there must ultimately be a physical space to eventually inhabit. This is the second important decision, what and where?

All the communities I visited had particular types of space they inhabited. All had to adapt and reuse space originally designed for other uses, each with their own benefits and draw backs.

If choosing an ideal from classrooms, basements, offices, factories, libraries, retail, exhibition and residential the best would be a combination of the scale and flexibility of a factory, with the visibility of retail. The worst type were basements and I felt that the Hobby Shop and Boston Fab Lab suffered from the restrictions of their inherited spaces.

# Context & Connectivity

The type of space, and its given context and connectivity are closely linked. While there may be less choice in finding a location for a maker space regarding type, there can be different opportunities in connectivity. In my visits decisions on location were mainly based on available and affordable real estate meaning that unless you are opening an entrepreneurial space like Bolt, or are tied to a University you will typically be inhabiting an area in need of regeneration.

In the city you live, first identify areas of perceived need for regeneration (not gentrification) where rental prices are low. Within this look for opportunities such as connections to education or existing community services, high pedestrian traffic areas, high visibility or opportunities to expand and inhabit the surrounding environment to attract people in.

The makers spaces that were able to physically or virtually connect to universities, businesses, peripheral creative activities, urban corridors or public space gained most from increased visitors and participation.

# Tools

When setting up a maker space it would be tempting to immediately go out and buy a few desktop 3d printers to get started. What this study identified though is that it is better to save up for a laser cutter. Ideally get both but if a choice has to be made reach for the lasers. The reason is that the laser cutter can help achieve 2d and 3d making projects while the printer, as its name suggests, works best with 3d. While the 3d printer does one job well, the laser cutter’s versatility makes its more useful.

Before both of these however there needs to be access to traditional hand tools to help fix up the space. This should develop into a dedicated tool storage with accompanied robust surfaces to prepare and work with materials.

Materials are critical to making. Each making project starts with a consideration of how material can be manipulated into form. Experienced makers learn what different fabrication processes enable and come to understand the material’s capabilities. The spaces which explored this further, such as The Makers Place in Sydney, produced the greatest variety of interesting outcomes.

The Makers Place provides information about material life cycles and the circular economy to educate its community about restorative and regenerative practices of making. Curated wall displays and projected information also provide a source of inspiration and examples of making techniques to engage with.

As the first digital tools arrive you will need powerful computers in order to communicate with your new machines. The ideal scenario existed at the Fab Lab Boston who offered Apple iMac computers running mac OSX, Windows, and Ubuntu, an open source operating system. This setup provides access to any type of software allowing your community to develop preference and skills for particular tools. If this is not viable then look to obtain PCs that are as powerful as you can afford, from which you could also run open source software.

# Funding

In order to set up a maker community you must consider money, as space, equipment, staff, maintenance and facilities all need capital. The reasons for forming a community usually tie closely with funding opportunities but unless your community is set up to generate money it will be the hardest factor to manage.

In this study funding sources ranged across membership plans, public investment, university funding, retail, fabrication services, teaching, donations and private sponsorship. The success of these was heavily dependent on the contexts the spaces were located in, but those who could tap into a number of revenue streams were the most financially comfortable.

Of these only public or private funding sources provide a true “democratisation” of making as economic discrimination is avoided. Unfortunately this model in isolation is not sustainable and unless you are tied to a benefactor who can invest their own wealth, you will need to look for other sources of income.

Membership was the most popular revenue source and has the flexibility to adjust as new equipment and opportunities are introduced. On top of membership, those sources of income which helped to solidify community such as workshops and special events were the first to be incorporated.

Overall sources of income were highly determined by the socio economic characteristics of their communities. In comparing Boston Fab Lab with San Francisco’s Tech Shop the former would be disadvantaging their community members if events or workshop fees were introduced, whereas the latter it would be expected, by its mainly professional members, to attract the necessary experts and equipment.

Danger Awesome provided the most financially astute and sustainable business model through diversification of revenue streams including retail, fabrication services and co-working opportunities. Unfortunately this strong entrepreneurial energy seemed to lose sight of the DIY aspect and "democratisation" of access to personal fabrication of which is claimed to belong.   

# Social Structure

As a community grows you will need to address how it functions socially and culturally. This decision has an important influence on how your community will perceive their common ownership in the space and affect users behavior.

In this study’s experience there were two main types of social hierarchy, the owner / user and owner / owner. The owner / user seemed to work well within restricted or private space where user behavior needed to be controlled. Owner / owner however was the most interesting, such as the hackerspaces visited, where permission and rights were equal to all. The drawback with this was potential for abuse as it relies on the honesty and integrity of a community’s members.

For me the most inspiring spaces fostered as flat a social hierarchy as possible. Those that could shift roles of teacher or owner (position of power) to student or user within their members, rather than relying or set roles, had the strongest community identities and greatest knowledge sharing.

Once a space has been found, it must be configured to welcome in community members,maximise making potential and foster optimum collaboration.

# Layout

Observations and feedback indicated that a system of zoning is essential in maker spaces to provide necessary spatial conditions for thinking, socialising and making.

Decisions for this zoning should be guided by a consideration of certain spatial performance dualities, loud / quiet, clean / dirty, open / closed, personal / communal. Each of these should be viewed as a sliding scales, and used to overlap and create a variety of spatial conditions. In general, larger machines such as CNC mills and laser cutters will require ventilation so it is advisable to locate this close to building perimeters.

The aim should be for flexibility so lighting, ventilation, work surfaces etc, should be able to be moved enabling different reconfigurations of the space. In a week your space could be hosting electronics and soldering, timber fabrication, digital design skills, or 3d printing workshops. It is unlikely you will have the luxury of dedicated space for all of these things so the ability to rearrange is important. Ideally the only fixed elements would be storage, lots of storage, to allow materials to be collected and recycled and for users to progress projects in their own time without fear of them visiting the bin.
Overall the range of making projects across the study was surprising. It was hard to predict what I would see in each space because activity aligned itself so closely with the personal interests of the community or the organisers of the space. General noticeable trends were sub-groups of making interests based on age with younger people engaging more with gaming, 3d printing and drone based projects.

Significantly, women were not represented in the maker spaces as much as men. They seemed to participate in the same types of making projects, but also engaged with hybrids of traditionally perceived female crafts such as robotically controlled sewing and 3d embroidery. While these were also open to men, spaces like Tech Shop and Boston Fab Lab used them as ways of introducing digital fabrication to female members.

The strength of the maker movement lies in the freedom and variety of interests of its members who have the naivety of non experts, but boundless enthusiasm and appetite for knowledge. Without the right guidance and inspiration though this can also be its biggest hindrance with a risk of the same types of 3d printed objects being reproduced without any thought. The last stage therefore is to think about what your community will want to engage with, both individually and collectivity, through identifying problems that surround everyday life, or engaging with more experienced makers practices.

# Outcomes

The introduction of varied design / fabrication practices at different scales will offer an insight into what is possible with the tools available, and create the conditions for new and novel ideas. Along side this it is important that the community you form realise the potential in combining tools for personal fabrication. For example this could be a project that combines a laser cut casing with a digitally prototyped interface, or CNC routed furniture with 3d printed connection components.

It is important to display the achievements of the community to generate pride in their achievements, and open possible revenue opportunities.

# Personal Fabrication for Architecture

Ultimately the attraction of facilities for personal fabrication comes down to the autonomy and freedom it offers to explore personal interests in making. In this study the majority of projects were small in scale and could be summarised as either employing engineering or industrial design approaches. This is not surprising as the maker movement emerged through the sharing of science and engineering projects with keen amateurs.

What if maker spaces could also engage with architectural problems, using design thinking and personal spatial intelligence? Although I unfortunately did not experience this in my study the potential for architect involvement, to offer expertise along side engineers, software developers and industrial designers, is significant. This input could reconfigure how makers approach their built environment and generate enthusiasm in shaping its future.

Community spaces of personal fabrication are avenues for knowledge, idea transfer and potential innovation. They promote learning, collaboration and in most cases in this study, sharing. They should install a confidence in their members to realise that anything they need can be designed and fabricated by themselves, and in doing so address personal and collective needs.
