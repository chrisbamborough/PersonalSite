As technology seeps into all aspects of architectural practice, Dancy Deutsh argues that a new type of professional skill set is required to navigate the capacities of digital tools and the future of automation. To paint a simple picture a "super-user" reflects the language concerning "users" and the design of technology, however while technology considers the user in the service of new digital tools, Deutsch's "super-user" is positioned as an innovation in human ability towards a manipulation of digital tools. Simply put the super user is a designer who can code.
