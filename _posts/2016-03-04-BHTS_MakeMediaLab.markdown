Maker Media are responsible for the magazine Make as well as numerous books that promote DIY approaches and solutions to common problems. Their office and day to day operations are in San Francisco, but located north towards the Golden Gate Bridge, in the Palace Of Arts, they have their  Maker Media Lab. Built in what is now a conference and exhibition centre, the lab is set up purely to indulge the professional and personal curiosities generated by those involved in the magazine.

The lab, which takes up a small corner of the building, has a devoted CNC woodwork shop with multiple scale shop bots, with the remaining space left for open plan working at stand up desks. A fluid arrangement allows equipment to be relocated to specific work space via ground level power points rather than continuously moving from work bench to fabrication tool. These tables also served as storage containers for materials and locations to display interesting projects.

On my visit I met Marty Marfin the Lab Manager and contributor to the Make magazine and website. He has a background in prop and set building and had a keen interest in how makers could generate innovative ideas around making music. During the summer Make media organise summer camp and always has a whole stream devoted to DIY music. Marty was enthusiastic about the potential for maker spaces to generate energy around things that would simply not be considered through the lense of  commercial research/ innovation. His and the labs ideology in general was that making through sharing, hacking and adapting of ideas was critical to the outcomes of maker spaces leaving the perceived territory of unsophisticated tinkering.

While I was talking to Marty he was working on his own project, a collaboration with marine biologist Christopher Lim, to produce an artificial 3d printed Oyster reef bed. He had identified a loss of their habitat at Point Emery and Point Molate in the San Francisco Bay area, and had the idea of creating a modular system that could provide a foundation for reef replenishment. Using the lab he had explored 3d design, 3d printing of prototypes, and the creation of injection molded polymer castings to explore possible solutions.

He referred to architects such as Lebbeus Woods, Buckminster Fuller and more recently Andrew Kudless as inspiration into material and tectonic investigation. As we were discussing architectural influence in his work I was introduced to Gary Rohrbacher of Filson and Rohrbacher and AtFab an open source furniture design company. He was based at the lab for a few days with the dutch Waag Society and One Architecture to announce the development of the Design / Fabrication Lab in Amsterdam.

This new type of makerspace would be devoted to making at architectural scales and exploring the maker city. I had caught them during a three day symposium where they were exploring themes around digital fabrication and maker culture and linking them to new entrepreneurial infrastructures and shared challenges within the construction. I made contact with Gary in between a busy schedule of sessions involving other participants such as Testa & Weiser Inc, Jelle Feringa and DUS Architects of the Amsterdam based 3d printed Canal House.
