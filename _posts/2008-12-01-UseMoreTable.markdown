Christmas 2008 I volunteered to help the charity SHELTER (http://england.shelter. org.uk/) by helping with the design and decoration of a drop in centre in South London. In addition to helping set up shelter locations around South London I  designed a cheap and simple to construct table that could be used in a number of ways. I wanted to design a low cost table for the users of the centre, that could also be turned into seating / space dividing furniture through simple manipulation.
The issue we identified was that if temporary furniture for Christmas shelter locations were to be created they would have to be able to be quick and easy to construct, whilst being multi-functional. The four part “Usemore Table” was designed to function primarily as a dining or work table, which could then be split into a table and seating or all purely seating.
Other designs from the group involved in Shelter included modular room dividers that could be adapted to different spatial situations, and Christmas decorations produced by local school children.
