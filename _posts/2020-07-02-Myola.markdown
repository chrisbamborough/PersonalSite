MYOLA is a three-bedroom house designed when working at the practice [Supermanoeuvre](http://www.supermanoeuvre.com/), commissioned after a family member lost their Trundle farmhouse to fire. While the house sits within acres of sheep farming land and supports the working farm it also provides a peaceful living space by inviting the beautiful surrounding landscape into the house, and encorporating high thermal efficiency. A decision to usr locally grown and procesed Cyprus pine provided two opportunities, one of tapping into an established material knowledge and the other as a termite deterrent, a significant problem in that area. 

The brief for the house centred around thermal efficiency and identified views into the landscape. As a response, MYOLA proposed to invert the traditional flat ceiling pitch roof rural farmhouse, to provide a flat roof with an undulating ceiling. This design move produced framed connections to the landscape, offered ample space in the roof for rainwater and solar harvesting while retaining an insulating ceiling cavity.

The house applies well established Australian thermal design principles by facing glazed aspects north, protecting from summer solar gain but invite winter sun onto concrete floor thermal mass. The project utilised digital thermal simulation to understand solar gain throughout the year, to calibrate the solar benefits and to help minimise glare from the rising eastern sun. The ceiling concept organised the house through changes in height and connected domestic activities to particular vistas.

The house layout organised around the thermally driven north/south aspect, and its relationship to the working farm. The house plan organises through three types of thermal environments, along the south wet areas offer utility spaces for transitioning from farm to house, the western bedrooms require greater insulation and separation from the rest of the house. In contrast, the main open plan living connects low-e glazing to north, south and eastern aspects and benefits from the thermal gain of everyday use.

The external appearance of the house developed through research into Cyprus pine's material propoerties, and an interest in the ancient Japanese act of [Shou Sugi Ban](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/shou-sugi-ban-black-waterproof-wood-furniture). The treatment of vertically placed battens, all hand burnt by the clients, added a unique black charred character to the house that contrasts with the environment. In addition to a beautiful visual effect, the charring adds waterproofing, further termite repellant and protects from future fire damage.

Myola existed as a full-service project within Supermanoeuvre, passing through all stages of sketch design, design development, construction documentation and contract administration working along side local consultants and an excellent builder.
