Set in a converted wharf along San Francisco’s Embarcadero, the software company Autodesk have built themselves a high end fabrication facility open for use by employees and selected artists in residence. The logic is clear, Autodesk make software that output data to fabrication machines, so in order to improve their software they have to understand and push the capabilities of these machines.

The facility initially served as a physical space to record content for Autodesk’s Instructables website devoted to presenting and explaining DIY projects. As the machinery brought in by the company became larger and more sophisticated the focus shifted towards creative exploration and investigation.

The centre’s main digital fabrication space is filled with a water jet cutter, 5-axis CNC timber router, 5-axis CNC metal router and an enormous 8-axis CNC milling machine that had to have a special reinforced concrete floor installed to avoid falling into the sea.

Beyond this double height space with overhead circulation gantry, there is a woodworking space, leading to a metal workshop. Up a level brings you to the rapid prototyping lab where 3d printers and laser cutters sit together. What marks Pier 9 from the other spaces I visited was the variety of equipment available, each with its own strength in making. For example different laser cutters provide different wattage power strengths and different bed sizes to cut through differing materials and provide varied finishes.

Back across the gantry of the fabrication lab the facility culminates in an office space and separate electronics workshops, a test kitchen, an industrial sewing centre as well as smaller specialty project areas.

The tour of Pier 9 was quick and I could tell our guide had better things to do (like make things) but it was possible to get a sense of the creative energy of the users through the projects in progress and on display. On my visit I experienced an artist creating a 3D printed vinyl record, product and fashion prototypes being assembled and the outcomes of 3d printed materials and fabricated geometry experiments.

Autodesk also have an office on Market Street in San Francisco and within it have a gallery for all the projects they create in Pier 9, along side the software tools that help achieve them. The company are extremely public and sponsor events throughout the city boosting communities of interests into innovation and generation of ideas. They realised the potential of digital fabrication and high tech manufacturing early and are fostering connected communities to provide distributed research and development across multiple design fields.

Autodesk provides an interesting example of a software company, focussed on computer bits and running agile and flexible work practices, but one that creates things made out of atoms and is reshaping how products are developed and distributed.
