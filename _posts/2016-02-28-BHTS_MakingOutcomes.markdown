If maker culture is to become a significant driver of innovation and cause a shift in economic paradigms then it is important to assess whether its output is significant. This is hard to assess as this study only explored the spaces of making rather than the space of use. However I was able to view and critique what existed as either projects in process, exhibitions of artefacts or left over prototypes.

The nature of things created varied across all the spaces, there was an immediate difference between those facilities which catered for regular member access, and drop in access. Spaces like Artisan Asylum had capacity to make and store large projects with the benefit of seven day access. The projects on show ranged from money making creative pursuits to hobby level play with electronics or materials.

Fab Labs in comparison catered for shorter intense making sessions. Here “hobby” style making was prevalent with examples of prototyping for flying drones or 3d character design for role play games. As the name suggest, The Hobby Shop also had a similar outcome, with a focus on small highly bespoke projects to address personal problems.

For maker spaces like Lowell Makes, it seemed that the more projects on the go the better. Rather than striving to create particular outcomes it seemed enjoyment was generated within the community from tinkering or taking things apart to learn. The projects tended to be more electronics based or hand crafted and proudly on show within the space.

The Hackerspaces were very different in their appearance: one a adapted office after hours; and the other a dedicated space for 24/7 activity. What they both shared was a focus on electronics and software based explorations making it hard to guage sophistication of output. However Richard, the founder of Cambridge Hackspace was in the process of creating a very polished home sensing and security kit with the hope of going into commercial production.

There are examples of commercially successful outcomes across all the spaces, but none quite as much as Bolt and Techshop which focus on entrepreneurial activity. In both these spaces examples were hard to come by as ideas and prototypes were so guarded and secretive.
This was in contrast to maker spaces catering for a younger audience, like Hatch and the Boston and Adelaide Public libraries. Output in these cases were crafted around the open sharing of digital 3d models allowing a focus on fabrication. These spaces act as gateways to making and the opportunity to borrow, creatively change and then share back is a quick and satisfying process. Objects on show in these spaces provided glimpses into the personal interests and identities of their creators but also highlighted a worrying trend regarding consumption and waste.

Digital fabrication in its utopian guise has the potential to allow humans to produce only what they need, to provide mass customisation in contrast to mass production of identical objects. The advent of the 3d printer promises the ability to produce almost anything to demand, but it also threatens a prospect of mass wastage caused by free data and abundant material. The presence of multiple yoda heads and other throw away consumer objects on display in these spaces indicated an unfortunate translation of a consumerist mindset into what should be about creation.

Danger Awesome, in its role as a custodian of fabrication, provided the most abundant selection of customised output ranging from laser cut jewellery and craft objects to assorted engraved materials and clothing items. Etsy.com provides a virtual market place for creatives to sell personal craft, in comparison Danger Awesome provides a more tangible version, but without the range of choice the website offers. Inspiration for objects within their retail section appeared to have come from sources such as Etsy or Pinterest. This raised the ethical question of wether any of the products were customsed in the computer or merely copied from visual examples?

At the Boston Fab Lab digital prototyping and fabrication is used in integrated education programmes for young people. Technology is used as a means to express themselves, build personal identities and communicate narratives around their life experiences. One example given to me by Dr Susan Klimczak,  Youth Education Director at the centre, was a workshop employing the modular prototyping platform Little Bits. One group created a chain of kinetic moments and designed objects to describe their experience with food trucks in the city. The resulting narratives highlighted the discrimination caused by high food prices and geographical bias within the city. What are seen by city planners as innovative and “distributed” supplies of food, actually exclude social groups through their economic model and location behavior.

Those maker spaces set up specifically for developing DIY projects, namely the Maker Media Lab and Pier 9, provided the greatest evidence of the future of creative making. At the time of my visit the Maker Media lab had users engaged in making CNC desk furniture, electronic projects, skateboards, gumboil machines, drones and 3d printed oyster reefs. Effectively, the future is explored in this lab and the incentive is high to develop engaging projects to publish in the Make Magazine.

This is not to presume Make magazine represents the maker movement. Make is a very successful business which fits neatly into the capitalist paradigm of production (magazines, books,  kits, events, conferences) for consumption which sits at odds with the potential of personal fabrication. Make does provide free tutorials and examples of what can be achieved which helps attract engagement with making.

At Pier 9 the incentive is just as high but for artists, given the freedom to explore and test the sophisticated fabrication machines. The only requirement from the artist-in-residence programme is that a tutorial must be developed and posted on the instructables website. This freedom has produced experimentation and innovation in 3d printing, geometry, and 3d modeling. The entrance to Pier 9 contains a number of previous projects completed by residents. On the day of my visit the space was dominated by a large pair of googley eyes that used mechanical parts coupled with electronic automation to create eyes that follow you around the room.

I think the freedom to explore what is personally motivating is what connects all of the making spaces visited during my travel. There are no deadlines, no expectations and no preconceptions only exploration, learning and self-expression through making.
