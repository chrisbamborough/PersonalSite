While in San Francisco I stayed in the SOMA (South Of Market) district of the city. After the 1906 earthquake the area developed around light and heavy industrial zoning. Today it attracts many software and hardware companies that flock to San Francisco for its successful entrepreneurial culture and loft style real estate.

In amongst the many industrial buildings and empty parking lots sits the Techshop, a membership based workshop that aims to provide a sustainably funded space and provides access to tools and software for the creative community.

There are currently eight Techshops around the US and they provide something a little different from the other maker spaces I visited on the trip. Imagine a gym for making and you are not far from the business model of this organisation. Overall it serves as part fabrication and prototyping studio, part hackerspace and part learning center and has access to over $1 million worth of professional equipment.

The company claims to be a community-based workshop and prototyping studio with a mission to democratize access to the tools of innovation, but it is hard to believe when access is $200 a month or $1650 a year.

This price limits membership to only those wealthy enough to afford an expensive hobby, or others investing in an entrepreneurial activity, this is where Techshops excel.

Using the example of software, maker spaces generally utilise open source programmes for ease of access and sharing, Techshops on the other hand are sponsored by Autodesk. This move could be seen in two ways: one is that Autodesk want to contribute to the local creative community, or they target Tech Shop users as potential customers for home licences.

In the case of Tech Shop, community relates to a working community that already exists in the SOMA district. Rather than generating a collective as hacker or maker spaces generally aim to do, they have tapped into an existing infrastructure of creative industries and employees who have ambitions to make and improve their skills. This point of distinction explained why the users of the space, when I visited, did not seem to know each other, and were concentrating on personal projects utilising time they had in the space.

On my visit I was shown around by Liz, one of Tech Shop’s “Dream Consultants” who are expert technicians of the equipment and represent certain professional making backgrounds. Liz’s speciality was metal work and taught classes on Tig and Stick welding in one of Techshops many organised classes. In order to use the tools provided by the space you must first do a training course structured around groups of tools.

These grouped tool sets unlock use of the space and mean users do not have to learn everything in order to make projects. The groups of tools relate to the spatial arrangement each Techshop follows. A factory like dirty space holds woodwork and metalwork machines plus industrial CNC machinery such as water jet cutters and routers. The large machines must be supervised at all times when in use and costs around $3 per minute to rent on top of membership.

In a separate cleaner and more laboratory like space is the digital prototyping facilities which provide open plan tables for work and collaboration.

Separate adjacent office space can be rented to local businesses, this is particularly popular with hardware start up companies. Type A machines are such a company who developed a 3d printer whilst renting in the Techshop. They had just vacated one of the offices and their influence was plain to see with a number of Type A 3D printers within the larger prototyping space.

This space caters for serious makers typically working on career changing ideas and provide machines which bridge the gap between consumer and high end manufacturing. The Techshop is very similar to the offering of Bolt without the pressure of expected returns on investment. Storage is critical and members have temporary access to lockable storage whilst working on  project. Desk space appeared to be on a first come first serve basis with many projects in progress reserving space. The overall building is a converted factory and has large openable windows which are perfect for the function of the space and the temperate San Francisco climate.

An interesting part of the prototyping space was a computer linked permanently to the US Patent and trademark office for those wanting live help with getting their ideas to market. It struck me that the Techshop offers the opposite of what a Hackerspace provides, the former catering for the market based mechanisms of the capitalist economy whereas the latter is based upon open sharing and social capital. Both interestingly produce entrepreneurs but I would expect that Techshop attracts those who are more interested in joining the system than subverting it.

Beyond prototyping the Techshop provides considerable communal social and teaching space. Just like a gym it provides the conditions to connect with other users as much as it does with engaging in activity and provides opportunities for different group sizes to congregatete and discuss ideas. Notice boards cover the walls advertising internal and external events and meet ups serving to promote networking in the community.

The tour culminated in the reception area which serves as the security point and the public face of the space. The public can gain access to this area and view some of the things created in the Techshop to hopefully become inspired. Objects such as a foldable canoe which was developed in house, and CNC manufactured furniture offer a flavour of what the Tech Shop offers.

The public can also access a retail store providing materials for general making projects and for use in the facilities. From the reception they also offer a 3D print service for members and non-members alike. Operating like a 3d print shop objects are printed for a fee, but there is no DIY access to this machine.

A Techshop gallery is located two buildings east from the main Techshop but was unfortunately closed the day I visited.

The gallery provides space for members to exhibit their work and for internal or external events to be held. Although the gallery did not appear to be particularly utilised it seemed to be a potential interface with the wider community, whilst providing publicity for the enterprise. If opened up for other niche interest groups, such as web design, it would widen the network and create collaborative opportunities for members.
