I managed to get to this years Serpentine Pavilion whilst over in the UK to see Peter Zumthor's only UK project to date.

First impressions were mixed as the scheme breaks from a fine history or interesting formal / facade designs. This year the form is a monolithic black cube that contrasts with the surrounding parkland blocking out the Serpentine gallery from the road.

The pavilion employs an enclosed colonnade which offer changing levels of light, this feeds into a central garden courtyard. The darkness of the entry produces a stunning effect as your eye has to get used to the light of the courtyard. The garden is an enjoyable experience offering an alternative nature experience to the grass park, and surrounding seats provide great conditions for contemplation or friendly commune.

Although formally this years pavilion lacks the punch of previous years it shows an enquiry into materials with Zumthor's interesting combination of ply and hessian textiles. The monomaterial of the architecture purposefully aims for anonymity in order for the garden to achieve maximum impact.

My only disappointment is that the sound quality produced by the hard surface of the pavilion is very poor and fails to create a space of serenity, talking voices reverberate to produce a sometimes annoying layering of noise.

Of all the pavilions I have experienced at the Serpentine it is the first to employ all the senses in it's conception, in this respect it is a sophisticated, controlled and expected approach by Zumthor.
