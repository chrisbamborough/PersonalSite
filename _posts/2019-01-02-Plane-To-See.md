Plane To See was a portable stand designed to demonstrate the technology of [Organic Response](https://www.organicresponse.com/). The brief was to create a foldable and transportable stand that could house a standard light fitting, and exhibit the ability of a [sensor node](https://www.organicresponse.com/technology/). supermanoeuvre's approach was to develop an origami-like folded form using Dibond aluminium sandwich panels, but shaped in a manner that achieved a Russian doll type storage.

The design was generated in Rhino 3D using the coordination and intersection of planar surfaces based on cross sectional profiles of decreasing scale (from the base to the head).

The stand consisted of a series of connected parts fabricated using CNC routing to cut and to control the angle of scored folding. These folded edges allowed concealed adhesion of the separate parts, with permanent nut/bolt fixings used to secure the assembled four pieces. Three models were manufactured and used by Organic Response in both UK and US demonstrations.
