In a [previous post][7277c25a] I wrote about architecture's need to develop an ontology of data to engage in the increasingly data-rich environments we live, work and play. The post used the work of Tamke. M, Nicholas. P, Zwierzycki. M [^5e841c8e] to consider the new way that data is being used in computational design processes in architectural practice, and argued that this approach needed a way of dealing with the spatial beyond the material and structural. In this post, I wish to consider the limitations of current thinking around Machine Learning (ML) and data, in a future post I will use this to examine other artistic fields who engage with data in other, less positivist, ways.

Generally speaking ML algorithms help designers with the following classification question, what is the characteristic of the input into a system based on a previous process of mapping between input data and defined classification outcomes? An ML system, once trained in recognising patterns through data, can conceivably reverse and input data concerning a classification can construct a pattern. In this understanding, one way provides knowledge through pattern, the other a pattern through knowledge.

The use of ML in the optimisation of structural systems and fabrication, as summarised in the last post, uses computer knowledge from previously understood conditions, to identify similar design outcomes and predict performance. This use of data presumes an objective status of data into the system, and production of objective data within the system even though the data and algorithms are outcomes of human practice. ML in the design of material and structural systems does not suffer from this assumption, but when applied to human behaviour the association of causal objectivity has deterministic undertones.

An example of this is the spatial analysis of We-Work who used ML to predict meeting room use based on an overall building layout[^8d228801]. In this project, pattern detection is sought between the interaction between people and their workspace. The resulting research methodology uses ML to train a model on the quantified abstraction of We Work offices, such as the number of offices, the size of the offices, the number of meeting rooms, and the facilities in the meeting rooms, and teach the system the relationship between office layout and usage. Two problems appear within this approach; firstly it is assumed that the use of meeting rooms obeys a causal relationship (rather than correlational) and that an understanding of office layout is reducible to a series of numeric measurements. From We Work's account, their use of ML was able to predict the usage of meeting rooms better than a designer. It is worth noting in this that the ML model predicted through a comparison of the measured and designed, while the designer predictions would stem from a comparison between a layout proposal and subsequent meeting room measurement. Accuracy is good if trying to reduce costs through spatial optimisation, situated within a business model of micro rents, but as ,a design tool, the ML model promotes spatial thinking constrained to existing conditions rather than encouraging alternative approaches. Additionally the data collected by We Work to train the model ignores social and cultural factors, or thermal performance in meeting room use, presuming instead that meeting room the use depends purely on spatial layout.

This spatial determinism is worrying as it has a parallel in the functionalist approach of modernism that assumed a standard architecture could operate internationally and produce the same performative effects independent of geographic and cultural context. To back this suspicion further the language used in promotion of machine learning in We Work's blog echo’s theories of scientific management applied to the efficiency in creativity that homogenised modernist architectural output through routinised design methods and propagation of spatial standards[^4f52f11c]. The use of ML in spatial planning design can be seen to freeze architectural design solutions within a repetitive cycle of extrapolation rather than invention into something new. The use of machine learning in We Work's hands will not promote outlier solutions who’s layout radically differs from other designs yet could potentially achieve better meeting room usage.

This and the last post have explored two approaches to ML in architectural design and has critically considered the assumptions and potential bias inherent in the use of data and the algorithms. In the next post I will explore alternative approaches to ML through the lens of art which use pattern recognition and prediction towards artificial creativity.
