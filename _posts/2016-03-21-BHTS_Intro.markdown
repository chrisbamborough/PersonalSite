Imagine a city whose inhabitants have a direct hand in shaping their environment ensuring additions address specific social issues. Imagine communities that don’t rely on imported goods or generic mass market solutions to solve personal problems. Imagine a household whose possessions are unique and tailored exactly to their life’s needs. Imagine bodies clothed in personally designed and crafted fabrics customised for body shape and self expression. The means to make is the key to these speculative scenarios and is seen in this study as an act of empowerment.

This project, “Making Culture” was initiated after identifying a global trend in the increased affordability and access to digital tools for design and fabrication. Some are predicting[^1] a shift in the means of production, from large industrial companies back to the everyday public, not seen since before the advent of modern capitalism

Increased innovation in digital manufacturing machines has caused them to get smaller and more affordable. The effects of these two factors in the realm of making is analogous to the democratisation of software development due to the internet. The creator of the Fab Lab foundation Neil Gershenfeld has identified that an emerging democratisation of digital fabrication is allowing a shift from the [ability to manipulate bits, to that of atoms][2]

In this project I use “Personal Fabrication” as a blanket term for digital making. Within maker culture there are many types of maker groups, so in order to bring them all together I adopted Neil Gershenfeld’s nomenclature. Put simply, maker spaces, Tech Shops, or hacker spaces as many were previously known, provide physical locations and access to digital tools for empowerment to develop. These spaces allow communities of people to form with shared social and cultural values. “Making Culture” examines the communities and the virtual and physical spaces that develop around digital making.  The study identified key case studies in the US and Australia that represent this emergence in order to learn how they operate and what they achieve.

In order to geographically concentrate case studies in the United States, two cities, Boston and San Francisco, were chosen to provide complimentary and contrasting observations. Boston is the home to the world’s first Fab Lab, has a very strong grass roots maker community, and has the conditions for entrepreneurship around digital technology and fabrication. San Francisco on the other hand is the epicentre of the American Tech and self titled “Maker Pro” industry whose aims are to profit through the culture of making.

The spaces identified and visited all similarly occupy forgotten, unwanted or awkward parts of the city. They re-use and adapt existing architecture, opportunistically inhabiting space, geographically distributed by economic real estate forces. Inside these spaces varieties of people engage in making projects whilst connecting socially, seeking common goals, observing collective codes of behavior, and sharing knowledge and experiences through participation and collaboration.

This study is intended to be read as both a source of information in engaging with digital fabrication and the maker movement, and a critical assessment into its capacity for transformative change here in Australia. It is divided into discrete sections that explore particular areas of significance identified live in the field.

Tools, explores the digital equipment utilised by maker communities and offers insight into the fabrication processes they make possible.

Case Studies, describes the spaces visited in the study through data collected in observations, photographs and conversations.

Movements, delves into the social structures that were identified amongst the spaces and attempts to identify differences in their motives.

Types, highlights and categorizes the typologies of space the maker movement is inhabiting.

Context and connectivity, assesses the importance of context for the emergence of maker communities and addresses the significance of connections, or networks, in their comparable success.  

Outcomes, summarises what is made in the maker spaces visited and pays attention to their potential to effect society beyond.

Maker Con / MAKER FAIRE, is a journal of my experiences at the MakerCon conference and Annual World Maker Faire held in San Francisco in May 2015.
