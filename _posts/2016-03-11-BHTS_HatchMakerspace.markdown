Libraries are becoming significant stakeholders in providing spaces of personal fabrication across the world. Institutions that were traditionally responsible for providing information for consumption now must engage with modes of production as the desires of society move towards increased generation of knowledge.

Once such maker space is Hatch which is associated with Watertown public library in Watertown, Massachusetts. While you would expect this to be housed within the building of the library it is instead located within the Arsenal Project a commercial endeavour to redevelop the Arsenal shopping mall in Watertown.

The Hatch public workshop is an initiative of the library with the theory that it can tap into the customer base of the mall and connect a new type of audience into the library facilities as a whole. At its inception Hatch identified a vital missing provision of making and associated facilities within public schools and wanted to test the willingness of young people to engage in making outside of school hours. For the mall owners their hope was that some of the maker movement’s perceived cool would attract more people to the mall and stimulate economic regeneration.

Janet Buck, who has an architecture background, runs the workshop, organises events and teaches classes within the space. She described the maker space as a test bed for teaching making skills and a space that can manage adaptive reuse as the movement matures.

The makerspace inhabits a small retail space that offers a front and back of house configuration with office space in between. The front area is visible to the mall circulation space and is used mainly for promotional purposes to try and catch potential user’s attention. It is here that the high profile facilities live; those capable of generating curiosity such as 3D printers or Little Bits prototyping modules, as well as screens used for teaching.

The hidden back space is used for the majority of the making activity and vital material storage. Janet has a strong theme within her workshops relating to adaptive reuse and recycling and has a knack of collecting lots of discarded materials. One favourite is cardboard and she utilises its versatile properties to provide introductory projects for new members. The critical aspect for her is for the users of the space to address personal problems with their own solutions and stories explored through prototypes.

Janet had observed that her design background gave her a different approach to instruction than other maker spaces which had more engineering problem solving approaches where the first solution is the solution. Her workshops promote the use of prototypes as a non-linear design process where the act of making can stimulate new understandings, ideas and approaches.

Electronics is seen as a vital part of this and a way of linking the manual process of making with the digital processes of 3d fabrication. Users of the space are encouraged to solder their own circuit boards and connect to computers via the Little Bits kits, and learn software to visualise ideas via sketchup, tinkercad and sculptress.

Its location within the mall, albeit slightly hidden away, has had varied success. Their current location is not big enough for the ambition for the maker space, it provides a visible face but has a limited capacity. The plan is to move to a larger retail space to gain suitable facilities but is heavily dependent on market forces of retail real estate. As with any case of gentrification the regenerating force could become a victim of its own success.

If more people use the mall demand will increase for its retail spaces and Hatch could be squeezed out as rental prices rise. It would need a socially aware commercial enterprise to realise that the removal of the stimulus could result in a return to previous conditions rather than follow purely economic benefits of market based efficiencies.
