The name "makery" seems a popular name at the moment, from the [UK Makery](http://themakery.co.uk/), the Sydney based [Sydney Work-Shop](http://www.work-shop.com.au) [Sydney Makery](http://www.work-shop.com.au/the-makery) to sell local designers wares, and the [NYC Makery](http://www.nycmakery.com) pop up maker space in New York's Brooklyn borough.

The Paris based [Makery](http://www.makery.info) is a fantastic resource that in their words provide "information on the emergence of a scene of labs, fablabs(fabrication laboratories, terminology born in the United States within the Medialab of MIT in 2001), hackerspaces(spaces self-managed by people wanting to re-appropriate technologies), medialabs, living labs(also known as third places, they encompass industry in processes of innovation and experimentation) and biohack labs (the scientific and bioinformatics version of hacker spaces).

What sets this site out is its questioning of the movement and those who are set to gain the most from its growth. At this stage they are funded by [Art2M](http://www.art2m.com) a company "specialized in the production and distribution of proprietary digital art or customised and innovative design". Their model for the website itself is open and DIY with content updates shared out amongst a small team. The greatest resource they have is an excellent open source [Makery Labs Map](http://www.makery.info/en/map-labs/) locating all the labs identified from their research and can be freely updated.
