I've previously written about the excellent web based resource [Makery](http://www.makery.info), on the 31st of March they published an article by Felipe Fonseca, who wrote the book [Repair Culture] (http://efeefe.no-ip.org/livro/repair-culture), claiming that "Maker Culture" was dead. For him the term "Maker Culture" has been hijacked by the capitalists that the original movement (i.e. Hacker movement) emerged to disrupt.

He argues that what has evolved is a shift from a creative engagement and subversion of established modes of production, to tedious market driven innovation obsessed with entrepreneurism. For Felipe making should foster a culture of conscious makers, recognise and promote alternative solutions and perspectives for everyday problems. He envisaged that distributed collaboration and a search for common good could fight cognitive capitalism, consumerism and alienation and provide possibilities for contemporary living and cultural diversity that reached far beyond the market economy mechanisms ruled governments and corporations.

The example used for this is the Brazilian cultural practices of gambiarra (to use improvised methods / solutions to solve a problem, with any available material) and mutirão (collective mobilizations to achieve an end). What interested me most about the article was his strong reaction against the "new industrial revolution" as coined by Chris Anderson, who he feels is committing the same mistakes, such as wasting resources and an obsession with wealth and fame, as its twentieth century namesake.

His point is a really important one to make, by using an comparison with the previous industrial revolutions, beyond providing mass customisation in manufacturing, it needs to deal with pollution, inequality, disintegration of cultures and social ties, permanent global war and many other consequences that the industrial age produced. The alternative should be "repair culture", as Fonseca's book suggests, that adapts and reuses existing products and technologies to solve specific problems within particular social and cultural contexts.

Whilst I completely agree with Felipe that the adaptive reuse of materials and technology is vital to shift human behavior from a consumption to creative production, I feel he is naive to think the outcome can compete with the innovation that capitalist entrepreneurism produces. The act of hacking, whilst essential in critically addressing social, cultural and political structures, will only ever produce sideways innovation via novel outcomes. Only an iterative non linear development of design can produce truly new and genuine innovation. For instance a faster microprocessor will not be developed via an adaptive reuse of existing components.

Ultimately though this type of research and innovation must be critical of its motives, is it enabled by capitalism to create social good and structural change, or is it simply to become rich and create new self serving structures of production, distribution and consumption. I think the two need to inform one another to ensure that common good can be achieved through market driven innovation, and that recycling and adaptive reuse can be incorporated into industry and customer desires.
