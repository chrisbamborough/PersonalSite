## Aims of writing.

When creating this website I set out a section to showcase my writing and to test ideas relating to my PhD.

My thesis examines the ontology of data in architectural design and argues that the material effects of its use in architecture have a historical lineage previously unstudied. Using the theory of assemblages as a research framework, as utilised by Deleuze, DeLanda and most recently Rob Kitchen in his work on digital data in research, the research compares three periods via how data is understood, produced and used in design, and demonstrates the influence of these data assemblages on the material outcomes of architectural production. The research sets the argument that data as an a techno-social system has influenced design since its emergence as a discipline mediating science and art. The work explores and interrogates how the concept of data has always existed but understood and described in different terms. The historical analysis attempts to identify a shift in architecture when the gradual de-materialisation of architecture overlapped a point where the cultural consciousness of data passed from an immaterial into a material entity. Within the PhD the ontology of data within architectural design touches on specific themes including the use of abstraction, techniques of materialisation, the influence of art and science, the link between data and scale, and the changing understanding of the architectural inhabitant through data.
