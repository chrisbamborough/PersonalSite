[Maker The Movie] (http://makerthemovie.com/) is "a feature-length documentary that looks into the current Maker Movement in America – a new wave of Do-It-Yourself and Do-It-Together culture fuelled by passion and powered by the advent of new technologies".

In the film's words "The "Maker Movement", sometimes called the "Third Industrial Revolution," subverts traditional manufacturing by building on innovative concepts such as open source, local manufacturing, crowd funding, and digital fabrication. Breaking the hobbyist movement stereotype, "Maker" delves deep into this ecosystem of design and manufacturing in the Internet era. The film explores the ideas, tools, and personalities that are driving the Maker Movement – and returns with a timely snapshot of one of the transforming influences of the current age" If you have read Chris Andersons "Makers: The New Industrial Revolution" then this film does not provide anything new. Its main point is that making at its basic level should not just be seen as simple tinkering and playing, it is actually providing the basis for a significant entrepreneurial and research community in design and manufacturing. The distinction of consumers v makers comes early in the documentation and argues that the web generation's new focus on the real world, from atoms to bits in Neil Gershwin's words" is what is fuelling this shift.

The emerging ecosystem of Education / Prototyping / Crowdfunding / Manufacturing is illustrated through a number of case studies ranging from [OpenROV](http://www.openrov.com/) [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/) [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/) smartwatch, [Lemnos Labs](http://lemnoslabs.com/), [AutoDesk](http://www.autodesk.com.au/), [Rickshaw Bags](http://www.rickshawbags.com/) and [Local Motors](https://localmotors.com/).

Overall the film's message is clear, in terms of design and manufacturing of physical objects power is shifting from large manufacturers to the "web generation", those who's creative culture is based on open sharing. What seemed to be missing though was a lack of consideration of design aesthetics within the whole movement. Problems are identified and solved through hardware solutions but can the "maker" when given the tools to design and manufacture actually develop a design aesthetic to trouble the Jonathan Ives of this world? It seems the designer who turns his hand to making rather than the other way around will produce the most beautiful outcomes as they have spent years honing their skills and design sensibility, saying that the designers may have zero capacity for business. Ultimately though the film highlights that the future will be mass collaboration that connect the best of all worlds.
