Adelaide Fab Lab is hidden away in the Adelaide College of Arts building on Light Square, in the North West corner of the city CBC. It is Australia’s first Fablab and was set up in 2012 with funding from the Australian Network for Art and Technology (ANAT) and the South Australian Government Department of State Development.

What initially started as a clever use of ANAT marketing budgets, buying a Thingamatic 3d printer and showcasing its potential across the city, quickly expanded into the setting up of a dedicated FabLab and then consequently Australia’s first Mini Maker Faire (more on Maker Faires later).

The current form of the FabLab is as a “squatter space” , as David Byworth the Fablab’s manager put it, within the Hassell designed Adelaide College of the Arts (ACA). They were generously given a workshop space by ACA and are sandwiched between other workshops ranging from fashion to traditional lino printing on the second floor of the building. In a conversation with David he said this was an important aspect of the current Fablab, both for building a community of users and maintaining an energy around personal fabrication.

Currently the Fablab has approximately 1,400 members of which a half are regularly active. The space’s initial and rapid success owes a lot of credit to Adelaide’s Hackerspace who have been active in the city since 2010. Their network of users combined with skilled and enthusiastic volunteers have enabled the Fablab to grow into a self sustainable enterprise.

The Fab Lab launched with a week long workshop run by Zoz Brooks, an engineer specializing in robotics and rapid prototyping and presenter of the TV show Prototype This. From this initial event it gained enough publicity and participants that the Fablab immediately had willing volunteers to supervise the space when active (currently two days in the week).  The volunteer staff are critical for Fablab, in David’s experience it was the digital machines that initial encourage people to visit, but the volunteers engagement, help and energy that created regular members.

However David has trouble retaining the fantastic people who offer up their time without the access to financial rewards as the Fab Lab is a not for profit operation and relies solely on public funding. David noted that the more commercial centres that exist in the US, like Tech Shops (more on these later), don’t have this problem as the people involved are paid staff and are invested in the success of the space.

In terms of the space David’s main concern was over air quality and noise with clear distinction between clean (3d printing) and dirty (laser cutting) fabrication. The open plan layout of the space is important for the spreading of ideas through conversations, but training and workshops were very hard whilst equipment was being used. The space currently has six UP 3D printers, a Trotec 300 laser cutter and engraver and a vinyl cutter. David felt the best situation would be to physically and audibly, but not visually, separate the quieter and generally more collaborative design stage from the more individual equipment use fabrication stage.

The software used in Adelaide’s Fablab tends to be as open source as possible to allow access for users outside of the space opening hours, but has had to invest in programmes such as Abobe Illustrator, Solidworks or Corel Draw in order to avoid errors in using particular machines.

This Fablab has been running for two years and has already had number of successes. The highest profile success is Voxie Box. Two guys called Will and Sean attended the first Fablab workshop and from that initial contact with others and gaining of fabrication skills were able to create some prototypes of an idea they had been working on for a while, effectively a holographic entertainment system (think R2D2 in star wars). Unfortunately they were not able to obtain funding for development of their idea in Australia and moved to New York, their product is now proudly part of the “Made in New York” (http://wearemadeinny.com/) initiative.

David pointed out that the Fablab serves as a place where ideas are brought in by users and engaged in through a network of skills, time and energy. One great example was of a vet approaching the Fablab Adelaide with the idea of 3d printing a bone of a dog to be operated on at a critical stage of an operation. After printing and subsequently practicing on it the Vet carried out a successful transplant.

Two years on the Fablab is at a critical junction, it has arguably outgrown its space at the College of Arts but its lack of revenue generation means that it can’t just choose which next commercial space to locate to. David’s view of the Fablab’s future is as a connector of people, skills and tools for private education institutions. Rather than siding with a particular institution, such as the ACA, David and the Fablab team have approached universities to fund the space so it can act as a neutral making facility for their use, with the added benefit of having access to potential research grants.

In addition there is also an opportunity for space at a new development at Tonsley where an ex Mitsubishi car production plant is being converted into a precinct that aims to attract entrepreneurs from mining, energy, construction, clean technology and health http://www.tonsley.com/

Finance is the critical aspect for the Fablabs survival and David has identified a number of revenue streams that allow equipment and space to keep running without threatening the Community Open Access model of the Fablab. Services could include making or designing for others, STEM education for schools, remote learning telecasts or specialised week long residencies.

What struck me most about the Fablab is the importance of its staff / volunteers who are critical in fostering participation and setting the expectation of achievement for potential users. Through their energy and skills the public have access to a space where they can introduce and test ideas, learn new digital tools and develop the confidence to either develop further or move onto other projects.
