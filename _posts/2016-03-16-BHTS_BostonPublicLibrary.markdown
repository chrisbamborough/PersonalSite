There are two sides to the Boston Public Library, on Copley Square the library is the 1895 building designed by Charles Follen McKim and contains vaulted ceilings by Gaustavino. The other is a 1972 extension designed by Phillip Johnson which provides space for large open areas for collections and working, in contrast to McKim’s traditional cellular room layout.

The Johnson extension is currently being refurbished and part of the development introduced a space exclusive to young people, teen central. Part of this space is given to a small maker space holding 3d printing and scanning tools, and a computer lab with access to software such as Adobe Creative suit and Autodesk.

I was shown around by Anna and Dave who supervised the space and organised classes and activities to attract and engage young people. They explained the ambition of the “hang out place” is to provide a means for self expressions and creation of personal identities. They consider making as significant as reading and socialising as important activities within this process.

The space had only just opened and had so far not attracted the regular visitors they had hoped for but those who were there were keen to explore the software and create digital artefacts within the lab. Their position within the library meant that many young people did not know they existed, but they felt that the space would soon attract regular visitors through word of mouth.

Dave explained that the fabrication equipment had not been used that often so far as users did not realise they were free to use, or know what to do to use them. While I was there an example of this happened, a girl asked what the 3d printer was and asked if she could see it work. When told it printed 3d objects she looked disappointed as she thought she would have to make something in 3d before getting to use the machine.

Dave introduced to her to Thingiverse a tool which he said had changed the way young people view and approached the technology.

Thingiverse allows people who have designed digital 3d objects to share them to a large online community, for free. 3d files are free to download and then edit and modify. It is encouraged that these new outcomes are then shared back to the community to produce an evolution of 3d forms. The website provides a digital commons of open source 3d printable objects.

Although he did concede that at the moment the printer was mainly being used to create easily available mass market products such as iPhone cases, but he could see that as software skills increased output would become much more personal and more in line with what he had experienced at the nearby FabLab.
