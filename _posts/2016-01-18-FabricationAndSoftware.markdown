I listened to the [Designalyze](http://www.designalyze.com/blog/podcast/episode-003-john-cerone) podcast with John Cerone of SHoP architects today and the conversation made me think about the critical role of 3d software in unlocking digital fabrication. At SHoP John is the director of Virtual Design and Construction [(VDC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_design_and_construction) and uses [3D experience](http://www.3ds.com/products-services/3dexperience/) by Dassault Systems to design, simulate, communicate and output for manufacture all within one ecosystem. Of course this software is not the only to facilitate this, there is also [Rhinoceros 3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/), Autodesk's products (particularly [Fusion 360](http://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview), and the web based [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/) but what struck me is that these are software products have been developed mainly for industrial / product design but are being pushed further and having their limits tested at scale by architects.

I believe that for Architects to remain relevant in the process of construction they must try to regain a means of production and do away with the convoluted and risky translation of 2d drawing to built form. The way to do that is through creation of accurate and detailed virtual models that can be translated automatically from computer file to factory manufacturing resulting in prefabricated assemblies of building components that produce more accurate built outcomes and provide more stable and comfortable working conditions.

Architecture can learn from product design and tech start ups who produce physical or digital prototypes, build data rich virtual models, materialise via additive or subtractive CNC fabrication techniques, producing outcomes directly inline with the designers original expectations. This type of workflow is not restricted just to the professional designers however, [Autodesk](http://www.autodesk.com/mobile-apps) identified an opportunity to engage DIY makers and developed free easily useable applications via Windows, Mac OS or iOS that open up immediate fabrication opportunities and provide an introduction to this type of development.

Soon we will see architecture students who have grown up with these tools and have the ability to generate physical building components using easily accessible digital design workflows. The biggest problem will be finding space for architecture studios big enough to house all the 1:1 and 1:2 prototypes.
