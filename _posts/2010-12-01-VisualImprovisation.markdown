<p>After a trip to Melbourne where I recorded lots of short 10 second clips of the city I have been trying to find a way to produce a film improvised to an audio track, effectively VJing or video creation on the fly.<!-- more --></p>
<p><strong>Ableton Live</strong></p>
<p>My initial idea was to use Ableton Live but in version 8 it is only possible to import a film to use as backing to create an audio track. Live at the moment won't allow video clips to be used in session view, it would be good if this changed in future but I can understand if Ableton don't bother as I have found may other commercial software packages for this.</p>
<p>As I have been trying to look for a way to use my existing owned or freely available software I persisted with the Ableton route to see if there were any other alternatives. There do seem to be other ways, for instance using <a href="http://createdigitalmotion.com/2008/02/av-cutup-secrets-using-lucifer-live/" target="_blank">lucifer</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://www.digitalfunfair.co.uk/avsync.htm" target="_blank">Isadora</a>&nbsp;which I think are the same thing, or part of the same programming language?!?!?!? Anyway its pretty obvious that my reading around came to a dead end as it seemed to allways either involve purchasing a new&nbsp;<a href="http://www.troikatronix.com/isadora.html" title="Isadora" target="_blank">graphic programming environment</a>, or trying to find plug ins which doesn't seem to exist anymore.</p>
<p>I did find another way of controlling video in Live but it meant purchasing <a href="http://www.ableton.com/maxforlive" title="Max 4 Live" target="_blank">Max 4 Live</a>&nbsp;package (&euro;249.00)&nbsp;then using a <a href="http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2009/12/09/midi-vidi-plugin-lets-you-control-video-via-midi-in-max-for-live/" title="MidiVidi" target="_blank">midi vidi plugin</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Processing</strong></p>
<p>So I turned to Processing which i have been learning for a few months now. I&nbsp;am getting to the stage now that I'm covering the use of video, however I'm realising that at the stage I am at doesn't cover the control, playback and sequencing of video only pixel manipulation. There are <a href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/" title="Processing Libraries" target="_blank">libraries</a> which I am looking into that look like they may be able to achieve this but its going to take some more reading into the <a href="http://users.design.ucla.edu/~acolubri/processing/gsvideo/home/index.html" title="GSVideo" target="_blank">GSVideo</a> and <a href="http://users.design.ucla.edu/~acolubri/processing/glgraphics/home/index.html" title="GLGraphics" target="_blank">GLGraphics</a> to see if the allow this kind of manipulation.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled across <a href="http://www.onar3d.com/mother/" title="Mother" target="_blank">Mother</a>&nbsp;which claims to be a host and&nbsp;"feotus" a&nbsp;library&nbsp;for Processing that allows the real time combination of Processing sketches to create VJ visuals. This has potential to be able to run code on the fly with the added control of video through extra libraries. I need to do more looking into this however.</p>

<p>In writing this piece I also discovered the work of <a href="http://www.flight404.com/vj/exhibit.html" title="Flight 404" target="_blank">Robert Hodgin</a> from back in 2005 which he used Processing to created interactive visual pieces controlled by 4 Griffen Powermate knobs, nice work.</p>
<p><strong>Quartz Composer</strong></p>
<p>I have an old G4 Powerbook running OSX 10.5 and a nice new iMac running 10.6 (Snow Leopard), and have recently found out about Quartz Composer. Through&nbsp;<a href="http://vjkungfu.com/archive/new-movie-loader-in-quartz-composer-for-snow-leopard/" title="VJ Video Import for Quartz Composer" target="_blank">VJ Kung Fu</a>&nbsp;I found a number of videos which attempted just what I have been setting out to achieve and it seemed to open up a new avenue.</p>
<p><object height="600" width="800"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=6351941&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /></object></p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/6351941">VJ Kung Fu: Better Movie Control in Quartz Composer for Snow Leopard</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/momothemonster">Momo the Monster</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>Quartz Composer appears to be an excellent platform to learn for visual programming, and seems to have a very large&nbsp;<a href="http://www.qtzlcodex.com/" title="Community" target="_blank">user community</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another VJ application based on Quartz Composer is&nbsp;<a href="http://coge.lovqc.hu/" title="CoGe" target="_blank">CoGe</a>. It is an open source application that is free to be used with the mac based software. However the maker of CoGe has decided to develop the software only for Snow Leopard meaning that I could only use this on my imac making live performance a bulky prospect.</p>
<p><strong>Pure data</strong></p>
<p>So from Quartz Composer I moved on to the open source PD after finding an article on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.estereotips.net/qeve/" title="Qeve" target="_blank">Qeve</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href="http://createdigitalmotion.com/2009/11/qeve-free-live-visual-vj-software-built-in-pd/" title="Qeve CDM" target="_blank">Create Digital Motion</a>&nbsp;website. &ldquo;Free Live Visual - VJ Software, Built in PD&rdquo; this sounded really promising, a handy link to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vdmokstati.com/2009/11/03/qeve-free-tool-live-performance-vjing/" title="Qeve" target="_blank">vdmo Kstati</a>&nbsp;website provided really good instructions for the download and installation of the PD patch. Only problem was that I didn&rsquo;t know what a PD patch was (still not totally sure) and it can only be installed in Ubuntu Linux, an open source operating system. Another dead end. It is claimed on the CDM website that it can be installed on the mac with &ldquo;some adjustments&rdquo; but doesn&rsquo;t go into what these actually are. I gave up on that one, if anyone has a mac work around could you leave a comment I would be really appreciative.</p>
<p>So after going over my existing or open source software I found myself looking at paid for packages that can work on their own or even plug into Live for midi manipulation. I don&rsquo;t really want to go down this route as I would much rather learn to use Processing, QC or PD to adapt to my own needs, however I thought I would list them as some have extremely powerful capabilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.resolume.com/" title="Resolume" target="_blank">Resolume</a>&nbsp;(&euro;299.00)</p>
<p>The Avenue 3 software allows you to connect to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.resolume.com/avenue/manual/tutorial_live.php" target="_blank">Live</a>&nbsp;and use Quartz Compositions in your mix.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vidvox.net/" title="VDMX" target="_blank">VDMX</a>&nbsp;(&euro;238.00)</p>
<p>This realtime video studio from Videvox also allows the use of QC patches, and has been optimised to run on older hardware.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.arkaos.net/product/index.php?catid=1&amp;pid=1001&amp;iid=42" target="_blank">ArKaos Grand VJ</a>&nbsp;(&euro;279.00)</p>
<p>Pretty much does the same as the two above, I&rsquo;ve read the most&nbsp;<a href="http://vjforums.com/showthread.php?t=26348" title="VJ Forums" target="_blank">negative feedback</a>&nbsp;about this package however.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.modul8.ch/" target="_blank">Modul8</a>&nbsp;(&euro;299.00)</p>
<p>Same same but multiple projection, I think.</p>
<p>So there you have it, there are definitely more VJ software packages out there, but I am going to persevere with Processing and Quartz Composer to see if I can get some real time control over video going for me. Any suggestions of other things I should look at are very gratefully received.</p>
