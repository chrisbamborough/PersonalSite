An initial 3D terrain using perlin noise to create the illusion of flying over. Adapted from [Daniel Shiffman's Processing example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKB1hWWedMk).

This started in an interest in how other data values could be mapped to the vertices and faces of the landscape to create other effects.
