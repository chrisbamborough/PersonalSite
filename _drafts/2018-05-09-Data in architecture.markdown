Data is a slippery term, in the physical world it is used to describe the detection of a lack of uniformity perceived by an "informational Organism" i.e. a human detectable translation of physical variations and requires cognitive processing[^1]. In computational terms it describes the smallest form of information, in an analogue signal (differing amplitude) or digital bits (1/0). In cognitive terms it is argued that data is distinguishable from information, the latter defined as something holding semantic content through the supplement of meaning[^2], but within the digital the terms data and information are used interchangeably. Extra confusion emerges when data is used to describe the means of transfer of digital information, data infrastructure, as well as digitally collected information, social media data.            

In contemporary life the cultural understanding of data is tied to technology such as laptops, tablets and smart phones with the "cloud" providing detached storage accessible via the global digital network, the Internet. The status of data within business has steadily increased with the progression of information technology hardware and software enabling larger and faster data processing. As a result the notion of the professional expert, someone who develops knowledge through application of information, is under pressure from sophisticated pattern detection and statistical prediction[^3]. The increased availability of digital data and computational processing has in turn assisted advances in machine learning[^4].

## The DIKW relationship.
Data is associated with research, the process of knowledge production. Information science understands data as the base of a hierarchy of meaning and context that passes from data to information, knowledge, wisdom, this is known as the DIKW pyramid[^5].

Data as start point, epistemology deals with how data transfers into knowledge

Data as fact - objective
Data as a signal - subjective - empirical perception
Data as a symbol

##Current Understanding on architecture
Data Driven design

Data Driven Smart Buildings   

##Definition for architecture.
Sensory perception is important for the design and experience of architecture.

Phenomenology tries to deal with this
Effect on practice....?
Architectural outcome...?

Human interaction with ubiquitous technology in the built environment increasing, requires an understanding of data as an interaction between physical and digital processes



The concept of data is important to consider in the field of architecture as

data is produced / accessed in space
physical increasingly connected to the virtual

Affordances of Data - abundance / realtime / searchable /

Traditional process placed on it - data driven design = discrete decisions justified through data.

## Data as a material - data poetics

Floridi identifies a pre-existing condition, pure data, as a form of proto-epistemic data, or what Floridi refers to as “Dedomena”, occurring through patterns or fields of differences in the universe.
