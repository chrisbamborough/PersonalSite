Last week I attended the Better Design Review Practices Symposium at UTS, day one involving a comparison of approaches to design review between the NSW governments architects, and the Dutch system of Quality (q) teams, day two concentrating more on the design crit in architectural education. While I attended both days I was more interested in the discourse around the design crit and was hoping to understand why the current design reviews operate like they do.

In the session three speakers provided their view on how the crit has evolved and its current failures. Michael Tawa, Joanne Kinniburgh and Kevin Heng gave similar and unique opinions into how design is assessed. I am going to use Michael's presentation to explore some ideas relating to my PhD.

Michael Tawa used extensive use of etymology to argue that the methods of assessment applied in contemporary pedagogy is unable to deal with the subjective and qualitative nature of architectural space. The reliance on metrics to measure and quantify performance in order to participate in capitalism places a framework of assessment around the design crit reducing it to rubrics, objectives and a discontinuous understanding. For Tawa the appropriate verb for the crit is to evaluate, to assign value to the qualitative and continuous nature of space experienced through time. The assignment of assessment to design situates the productive moment of architecture in the realm of consumption, reduing a reading through the lens of utility, an alternative to this is to view the crit as a productive moment in itself detached from an end product but as a "network of ideas that can be unfolded".

In Tawa's presentation I made the connection to DeLanda's theory of assemblages as a way of understanding through the emergent process of becoming rather than an analysis of a static object.
