There has been a lot of recent ups surrounding Mixed Reality ever since Microsoft and Magic Leap announced their headset technologies in 2017. I recently tried the Hololens in a workshop exploring its potential for computational design and digitally assisted hand assembly. This was all enabled by the Fologram team who were demoing their software and previous projects.

Mixed reality differs slightly from Augented Reality (virtual objects placed within an camera image of reality) and differs a lot from Virtual reality (a complete virtual image) by providing a virtual overlay onto a clear screen in front of your eyes. The effect is   Easy on the eyes as the only pixel information it must take in is added to the normal view of the world. For architecture this has many benefits which I will now consider.

Mixed reality coupled with a three dimensional model can project virtual geometry into space, the effect is a new type of architectural representation. Instead of describing architecture through flat drawings or screens, virtual form is overlaid onto a surface so it can be vieweable through the position of the body and head rather than the position of a virtual camera. From the perspective of constructing material assemblies this is very useful as it can show accurately where to place and join materials into a structure. What is more a number of hololens headsets can exist in the same model meaning multiple people can join in the construction.

With this basic setup opportunities for innovation exist in the way users can interact with the model in space through gestures, and through how geometry is processed within the Rhino and grasshopper environments. A full cyber=physical system is possible where input into the hololens by interacting with the virtual overlay feeds into a parametric model, which calculates adjustments and then feeds back into the virtual overlay. In the hololens environment the human user can design within the context while computation can calculate material performances. 

The applications of the system are already being explored with teams of students constructing advanced structures from timber and metal and using fixing methods such as tiying and welding. The combination of dynamic digital model and 1:1 virtual overlay means that tasks that previously required tacit material knowledge and craft skill can be done by anyone with hands and arms.
