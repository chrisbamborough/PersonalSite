My work recently had an art competition and the theme was Green. This made me think about the song "It aint easy being green" by Kermit the Frog, so I decided to write a <a title="Processing" href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a> sketch that displayed Kermits image but using the repeated words "it aint easy being". Each letter picked out a pixel colour within a 5 pixel area to create the image, the code is below if you would like to try it yourself. Thanks to <a title="Daniel Shiffman" href="http://www.learningprocessing.com/">Daniel Shiffman</a> who's <a title="Learning Processing" href="http://www.learningprocessing.com/">book</a> I have been using to learn Processing, this sketch was adapted from his Text Mirror example for a webcam video feed.
