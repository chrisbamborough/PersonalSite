In his [AR article](http://www.australiandesignreview.com/features/35295-the-end-of-prefabrication) published in 2013 Chris Knapp declared the death of prefabrication. Rather than discounting its significance, Knapps polemic stance was a call to arms for contemporary architecture to wrestle prefabrication from the grip of stigmatised modernist paradigms.

However where modernism championed the 2nd industrial revolution's mantra of standardisation, today digital fabrication provides the means for mass customisation. For contemporary conditions the term "prefabrication" for Knapp is "a conceptual and semantic anachronism, and a deleterious one at that" because it does not communicate the capacity to produce mass difference in a highly competitive building industry.

The outcome is "offsite construction", effectively controlled conditions for the fabrication and construction of a mass customisable elements. This allows architects to manage risk and provide greater precision achieving expected tolerances of millimetres rather than the traditional  tens of centimetres.

Emerging alongside this approach is the idea of construction sets, systems of building components that when assembled like a flat pack piece of furniture achieve set formal outcomes or more interestingly personally designed solutions. One high profile construction set making its way around the architecture blogs currently is the Wiki House, which I wrote about in my [previous post](http://www.smoothspace.me/a-open-source-architecture/), provides such a system with the added benefit of being open source.





The Wiki House development is currently up to prototype 4, each getting formally more rectilinear. The construction technique the system employs is effectively a vertical and horizontal sectioning of a preconceived form, which up until now has been a box with pitched roof, or a box.  The sectional frames do the job of a traditional wall column and roof beam combination and are then braced using horizontal elements, and held together via tenon joints and fixing dowels.  This frame setup provides a thickness in which to sandwich insulation between an interior and exterior envelope, and heads and sills for standard fenestration.

Provides a quick way to construct but does it allow people to design better architecture?

Web Interface

CNC router fabrication - flat sheet material

so lets look at the design solution
standardised / 3d model based / no context - purely internal desires

Using most recent house as an example - http://www.londondesignfestival.com/events/wikihouse

web based sharing network

Architecture following rather than innovating,
web allows sharing and communication
but has access to computational power, i.e. is excellent at carrying out repetitive tasks.
Web tools to enable mass customisation
