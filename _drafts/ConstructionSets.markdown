In his [AR article](http://www.australiandesignreview.com/features/35295-the-end-of-prefabrication) published in 2013, Chris Knapp declared the death of prefabrication. Rather than discounting its significance, Knapp's polemic stance was a call to arms for contemporary architecture to wrestle prefabrication from the grip of stigmatised modernist paradigms.

His position aligns with a shift in how production is considered, from a modernist perspective that championed mass production and standardisation, to a contemporary condition of digital fabrication providing the means for mass customisation and variation. The term "prefabrication" for Knapp is "a conceptual and semantic anachronism, and a deleterious one at that" because it does not communicate the capacity to produce mass difference in a highly competitive building industry. Knapp's promotion is for "offsite construction", actually controlled conditions for the fabrication and construction of mass customisable elements. This allows architects to manage risk and provide greater precision achieving expected tolerances of millimetres rather than the traditional tens of centimetres.

Emerging alongside this approach is the idea of construction sets, systems of self build components that when assembled like a flat pack piece of furniture achieve established formal outcomes or potentially customised solutions. One high profile construction set currently making its way around the architecture blogs is the Wiki House, which I wrote about in a [previous post](http://www.chrisbamborough.com/blog/2012/04/13/OpenSourceArchitecture.html), it provides such a system with the added ambition of being open source i.e. open for anyone with the useful skills to be involved. An Australian version which aims to provide small flat pack homes using integrated structural, thermal and waterproof panels will soon launch in Sydney. [Big World Homes](http://bigworldhomes.com/) held a communities workshop on the 29th of September this year so I plan to write about this at a later date.

# Design v Construction.
There are two forces at work within Knapp's argument, design and construction. Construction has the means to produce difference, illustrated in Knapp's own architectural work. Digital fabrication provides producers with the ability to constantly alter output based on digital input. This digital input however still relies on a fixed design sent via a designer to be fabricated. The modernist paradigm still prevails where a single design is produced, but one that requires many customised construction elements, this result makes the job of construction harder, and the perception of the architect as designers of complex and time consuming jigsaw sets.

This can be seen in the the Wiki House development which is currently up to 4 types differing in scale. The construction technique the system employs is effectively a vertical and horizontal sectioning of a preconceived form, which up until now has been a box with pitched roof, or a box. The sectional frames do the job of a traditional wall column and roof beam combination, then braced using horizontal elements, and held together via tenon joints and fixing dowels. This frame setup provides a thickness for sandwich insulation between an interior and exterior envelope, with heads and sills for standard fenestration. The project is making an excellent attempt at modernising the process of building a domestic building, an innovative open chain aims to stimulate greater collaboration between building users (and client) and built environment experts, aiming to avoid the political control of industry middle men such as developers and real estate agents. This promise, as yet, doesn't include the means to parametricaly customise the wiki house types which would increase participation from the client, the potential for difference and stimulate demand.   

# From object to experience.
The issue of where fabrication and construction occurs, on site or off, pre assembled or not, will remain depending on the building culture a project fits within. The larger issue exists in how customisation through design can be made a competitive advantage so that any actor involved in construction has an incentive in producing different outcomes. In a profit driven market based economy this incentive comes from greater demand, cheaper material costs or quicker construction time (reduced labour costs). If possible outcomes becomes abundant through easier access to designed difference, then value could start to be based on the experience of designing, building and living rather than treating architecture as an commodified object.

# Data, Interaction, Connectivity, Graphics
Architects need to become better equipped in using web technologies as it provides the means to fill this design gap needed to realise mass customisation that architects dream of. Web applications (rather than web sites) have the capacity to represent via sophisticated 3d graphics, provide real time and asynchronous interactivity, allow access to recorded or even real time sensor data with the immediate means to analyse and visualise patterns, and facilitate immediate collaborative feedback. Architects are (mostly) not software architects so this shift would require platforms to be developed or simple APIs (Application Programming Interface) or SDKs (Software Development Kits) so those will web development skills could construct such a design environment.

A web based design process involving clients and consultants could finally provide the means and demand for difference who's materialization could only come via offsite digital fabrication and construction.
