## "The limits of my language define the limits of my world." - Ludwig Wittgenstein

The history of the computer in experimental architectural design can be broadly summarised as thus, the computer as draughting tool (1960s), the computer as signal processor (1970/80s), the computer as animation calculator (1990s), the computer as relationship manager (2000s), the computer as generative tool (2010s). With each advancement of computational expertise in design experimentation, the role of decision maker and author has blurred in the collaboration between the human designer(s) and digital machines. The most recent shift abstracted the use of computation from techniques of representations, modelling and simulation through proprietary software packages, to custom software tools that could afford new relationships between representation, material and fabrication.

In these shifts a common trend emerges, a distinct attitude and skill in manipulating data, and shifts in language between humans and machines. The table below describes the differences



|      | Drawing     | Signal Processor     | Animator     | Parametric     | Generative     |  
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| Data  | Input    | Input / Output  | Geometry | Storage | Search  |
| Language | Interfaces (Gestural)| Low Level (Machine Language) |Software Package| Graphic Programming | High Level Syntax |         

## Art v Science
Data driven by scientific thinking, art interested in language
