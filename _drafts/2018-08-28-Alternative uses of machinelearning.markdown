In a [previous post][7277c25a] I wrote about architecture's need to develop an ontology of data in order to engage in the increasingly data rich environments we live, work and play. The post used the work of Tamke. M, Nicholas. P, Zwierzycki. M [^5e841c8e] to consider the new way that data is being used in computational design processes in architectural practice, and argued that this approach needed a way of dealing with the spatial beyond the material and structural. In this post I wish to consider the limitations of current thinking around Machine Learning (ML) and data, and consider other artistic fields who engage with data in other, less positivist, ways.



The two above examples of ML in architecture are problematic in their own ways, as a common criticism both consider the human in a student teacher relationship where data is not seen to transfer between human and non-human. In art ML takes into account the subjective designer as a data participant, and radically rethinks the nature of data within a non-human learning system. To demonstrate this two projects are considered, the use of machine learning in musical performance, and the other as generative process for unrecognisable imagery.

In Rebecca Fiebrink's practice she treats data as a communication channel to instrumentalise human modalities into a digital outputs.
