The third year "Integration" design studio required students to design a High School to demonstrate the skills and knowledge gained in their three year undergraduate degree. As a graduation project the studio asked students to tackle the complex architectural problem of a school in Sydney's Olympic Park, to to accommodate approximately 800 high school students between the ages of 11 and 18. The project brief stipulated that the school be split into a lower, middle and upper school, but the studio encouraged designers to encorporate shared spaces and provide flexibility in alternative configurations and relationships across the school, and with the community. The consideration of spatial relationships in teaching and learning, and suppport for different teaching and learning styles such as project based learning, cooperative learning, peer tutoring, provided a important driver for architectural design.

Community access to school buildings outside of hours will be encouraged, particularly the gymnasium, theatre and hall. Community access will also be encouraged during school holiday periods and students should explore ways to accommodate programs that form part of events at Homebush Bay such as the
Easter Show and large scale sporting events.
