In 2018 I coorindated and co-taught the 3D Modelling and Fabrication studio at the University of Sydney under the guidance of [Rizal Muslimin](https://www.sydney.edu.au/architecture/about/our-people/academic-staff/rizal-muslimin.html). The course introduced students to designing, modelling and fabricating objects and composite structures at multiple scales. A series of lectures and associated computer lab tutorials demonstrated workflows in modelling and fabrication using Rhino 3D and 3D printing and laser cutting machines within the faculty's [DMAF Lab](https://www.dmaf-lab.com/).
