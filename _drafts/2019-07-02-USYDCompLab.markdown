The MARC Computer Lab provided a series of tutorials to students participating in the Digital Architecture Research Studio at the University of Sydney. The lab introduced students to algorithmic modelling through Rhino 3D's grapical scripting editor Grasshopper and provided consultancy suppport at the culmination of design projects. Myself and Ivana Seizova, along side a paralell session run by Eduardo Barata and Xi XX, taught the logic of algorithmic modelling and introduced concepts of simulation, recursion, form finding and finite element analysis as potential design focuses. 

The lab provided a foundation to using Grasshopper's built in functions and extended functionality through external plugins such as Kanagaroo, Ladybug and Anemone. The lab used the generative design theory of Stiny's shape grammars to help explain serialised geometric transformations in 2d and 3d and the skills of debugging.
