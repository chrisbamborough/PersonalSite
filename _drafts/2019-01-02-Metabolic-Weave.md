Meta_Weave is an investigation into the form finding capacity of woven doubly curving 3mm plywood strip, their structural capability, and the expressive potential of their interaction. The project’s ambition is to study the capacity for a considered assemblage to effect the perception of material and light. Using Gottfried Semper’s 19th Century theory of Metabolism as a departure point, the project studies three case studies, Timber Weave, Meta Patch, and Serpentine 2005, to glean a trajectory of investigation. Semper’s theory was that architecture was rationally reducible to the materials and processes associated with their uses. It was concerned with the categorization and cross over of material production techniques, his 4 catagories of materials - pliable (fabrics), soft (clay), stick like elements (wood), dense (stone) identified 4 abstract catagories as elements of architecture, Textiles(weaving), Ceramics(forming), Tectonics (connections), Stereotomy (packing). The intention of the projects inquiry was to explore the multi employment of a prototype unit system to achieve conditions of tectonic and stereotomy states using the technique of textiles.
