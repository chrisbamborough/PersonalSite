Reinterpretation of Le Corbusier's Mill Owners Association building in Ahmedabad

“Animate Networks” was created with Rasmus Holst and is the re- imagination of the Mill Owners Association Building by Le Corbusier in Ahmedabad. The project is conceived through three interconnected spatial journey experiences, configured through a self-arranging system of programmatic desires and cinematic narrative structures. Synthesis of the projects ambition is achieved through the form found interaction and turbulence of strand components, influenced by an codified field of internal and external forces.
