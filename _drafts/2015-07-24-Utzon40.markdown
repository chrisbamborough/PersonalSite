I collaborated in designing, fabricating and constructing the Utzon 40 pavilion as part of a research team involving [supermanoeuvre](http://www.supermanoeuvre.com/), [Aarhus University School of Architecture](https://aarch.dk/en/) and [UTS School of Architecture](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-design-architecture-and-building/architecture). The project took the name "Utzon 40" as the prototype celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Opera House, and presented at the [Architecture and Design Symposium](https://www.architecture.com.au/news_media_articles/architecture-and-design-symposium-celebrates-40-years-of-sydney-opera-house/). The pavilion acted as a tribute to Utzon's design and construction principles while producing innovations in computational design and digital fabrication.

The project initiated through two separate material investigations, Aarhus's prefabricated concrete base structure designed to not require formwork, and supermanoeuvre / UTS reciprocal timber frame research.
